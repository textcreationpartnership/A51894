                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684, when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw ; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>EXPECT no more Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Arabian Author;</hi> or Apologies for any Thing that may ſeem liable to Cenſure in his <hi>Letters.</hi> There is no End of anſwering the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of thoſe, who to gain the Character of <hi>Criticks,</hi> will create <hi>Faults</hi> where they find none; and impute the very <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights</hi> of the <hi>Preſs,</hi> to the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> rather than a <hi>Book</hi> ſhall eſcape free from <hi>Cenſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is wanting in the <hi>Style,</hi> where it may be ſuppos'd to come ſhort of the <hi>Original,</hi> muſt be laid to the <hi>Italian</hi>'s Charge, who undertook the <hi>Firſt Verſion</hi> of ſo <hi>Remote</hi> a <hi>Language.</hi> For, the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlator</hi> has endeavour'd to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as cloſe as the difference of <hi>Idioms</hi> will admit. And all the World knows, That the <hi>Engliſh Tongue</hi> is none
<pb facs="tcp:102962:4"/>of the moſt Copious and Significant. But, if this ſhall ſeem an Invidious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubſtituted in the Room of a Paſſable Excuſe; the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlator,</hi> in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both of the <hi>Foreign Copies,</hi> and his own <hi>Native Language</hi> (for he is a true <hi>Engliſh-Man</hi> both by <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi>) is willing to take the Blame of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on himſelf. Aſſuring you, That whatſoever Roughneſs or Want of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; Whatſoever Careleſsneſs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is to be found in the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> though it may be a Fault in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, yet 'tis purely owing to the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of him who has committed it. Since, the Chief Reaſon of ſuch Neglect is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was loath the <hi>Reader</hi> ſhould loſe the <hi>Original</hi> Sence, for the ſake of a Sweet-Period, or a Delicate Cadence.</p>
            <p>If in other Places he ſeems affected, as in retaining the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> or <hi>Arabick</hi> Words, where they might as well have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Engliſh;</hi> this alſo was out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his <hi>Copy,</hi> where thoſe Words are left, as, we may ſuppoſe, they were found in the <hi>Original Arabick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is addreſs'd to ſuch <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as have procur'd the <hi>Italian Copies</hi> of theſe <hi>Letters.</hi> For, we are inform'd, That they are in the Hands of ſome <hi>Engliſh
<pb facs="tcp:102962:4"/>Travellers,</hi> who had a Curioſity to compare the different <hi>Tranſlations</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>However, to Evidence that this is not ſpoken in Partiality to our ſelves, but with Equal Regard to that Learned <hi>Foreigner,</hi> who firſt brought theſe <hi>Letters</hi> to Light; It will not be amiſs to exhibit ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reaſons, as might induce him to leave <hi>Some Arabick</hi> Words untranſlated rather than <hi>Others,</hi> though they had both the ſame Sence.</p>
            <p>The beſt Method of clearing up this Point, will be by producing Inſtances, ſuch as that, Page 53, at the Bottom: Where the Word <hi>[Vizirs]</hi> is retained by the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlator,</hi> becauſe it was not chang'd by the <hi>Italian.</hi> Doubtleſs, it had been as eaſie to ſay <hi>[The Seven Chief Spirits, Angels, Chancellors or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Above]</hi> as <hi>[The Seven Vizirs.]</hi> But ſince the <hi>Italian Copy</hi> has not alter'd the Word <hi>[Vizirs]</hi> the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlator</hi> thought fit to let it ſtand. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, 'tis proper enough in both <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi> becauſe it better expreſſes the Thought of the <hi>Turkiſh Author,</hi> than any <hi>Italian</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Word can do, being a <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Ottoman Empire:</hi> Where the Credulous People
<pb facs="tcp:102962:5"/>are made to believe, That their <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> with all its <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly Modell'd according to the <hi>Pattern</hi> of the <hi>Celeſtial Court</hi> and <hi>Kingdom.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it appears very Natural in a <hi>Turk,</hi> to call the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> by the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Vizirs, Beglerbegs, Baſſa's,</hi> or whatſoever other Appellatives are us'd by them, to expreſs the Dignity of their <hi>Grandees</hi> on Earth. And who would go to ſpoil his Sence, for the ſake of a Word?</p>
            <p>Beſides, not to let this Paſſage fall, without due Remarks; Is it not Common in our <hi>Bible</hi> to call <hi>God, [Lord of Lords?]</hi> And how can this be otherwiſe expreſſed in <hi>Arabick,</hi> but by the <hi>Title</hi> which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the <hi>Principal Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces,</hi> whom in their <hi>Language</hi> they call <hi>Beglerbegs?</hi> It is equally uſual in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to ſtyle <hi>God [King of kings]</hi> a <hi>Title</hi> frequently aſſum'd by the <hi>Eaſtern Monarchs.</hi> Nay, in our Common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, here in <hi>England,</hi> it is Cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>[The King of Heaven.]</hi> And why may we not as well give to the <hi>Arch-Angels</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Titles</hi> which are ordinarily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> on <hi>Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, if this will not appear allowable in a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yet no Man can
<pb facs="tcp:102962:5"/>wonder at a <hi>Turk,</hi> when he hears him uſe his <hi>Native Dialect,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates Above.</hi> And if this be granted, I hope, neither the <hi>Italian</hi> will be blam'd for preſerving the <hi>Peculiar Phraſe</hi> of an <hi>Eaſtern Author;</hi> nor the <hi>Engliſh Tranſlator</hi> be accus'd, for following ſo Polite a <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Inſtance had not been preſs'd ſo far, but in Hopes that what is already ſaid, may ſerve as a Plea for ſeveral other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of like Nature in this <hi>Volume:</hi> Where it is impoſſible for any <hi>European,</hi> to expreſs the Full Meaning of an <hi>Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Author,</hi> without reſerving ſome Words of his very <hi>Language.</hi> And in this, the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Tranſlator</hi> is chiefly vindicated; from whoſe <hi>Copy,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in ſuch Caſes, had no reaſon to ſwerve. And thus much may ſuffice to anſwer all Objections about the <hi>Style.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Matter</hi> it ſelf, it appears full of Inſtruction, in <hi>Hiſtorical, Moral</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Affairs. Nor need any Man wonder, if he encounters ſome Paſſages which may be found in other <hi>Writers,</hi> both <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> ſince the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of theſe <hi>Letters</hi> profeſſes, That he has taken much Pains to peruſe the <hi>Treatiſes</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> both whilſt he
<pb facs="tcp:102962:6"/>ſtudy'd in the <hi>Academies,</hi> and during his Reſidence at <hi>Paris,</hi> he often frequented the <hi>Libraries</hi> in that City; whereof there is no Scarcity. He ſpent a great Deal of Time, in reading <hi>Modern</hi> as well as <hi>Ancient Authors.</hi> By which Means, he not only improv'd his Knowledge in the Univerſal <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Former Time,</hi> but grew Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with the moſt Remarkable Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in <hi>Europe,</hi> during theſe Later <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies.</hi> So that in ſome of his <hi>Letters,</hi> one would ſwear, he had read <hi>Sabellius, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus Juſtinianus, Philip de Comines,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>European Writers.</hi> For, he ſeems to come very near them, in relating ſome <hi>Particular Stories.</hi> And it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that he took this Advantage to oblige the <hi>Turkiſh Grandees</hi> to whom he writ, by inſerting in his <hi>Letters,</hi> ſuch Paſſages as they were wholly Strangers to.</p>
            <p>There need no more be ſaid, but that you may expect another <hi>Volume</hi> of theſe <hi>Letters</hi> very ſpeedily. Farewell.</p>

                  <head>Mahmut <hi>the</hi> Arabian, <hi>and Indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable</hi> Slave <hi>to the</hi> Grand Signior, <hi>to</hi> Mahomet, <hi>the Moſt Illuſtrious</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zir Azem, <hi>at the</hi> Port.</head>
                  <p>I Congratulate thy Aſcent to that Top of Honour, the <hi>Firſt Dignity</hi> in the <hi>Empire Ever Victorious.</hi> 'Tis thy Turn to be now Exalted in the <hi>Orb</hi> of <hi>Fortune:</hi> Let not this High Station make thee forget, That that Wheel is always in Motion. But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102962:14"/>conſider, That ſince the Advance thou haſt made, was not but by the Fall of thy <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</hi> thou haſt the leſs Reaſon to think thy own State ſecure.</p>
                  <p>I am no <hi>Fortune-Teller;</hi> nor would I be ſo rude, as to Prognoſticate Ill Luck to my <hi>Superiors.</hi> But, Men in Eminent Dignity, have Need of a <hi>Monitor:</hi> And, it is Recorded of a <hi>Great Monarch,</hi> That he Commanded One of his <hi>Pages,</hi> every Morning to ſalute him, when he firſt awaked, with theſe Words, <hi>Remember, O King, that thou art a Mortal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let this Example, Supreme <hi>Miniſter,</hi> plead my Excuſe, and incline thee to pardon the Freedom which <hi>Mahmut</hi> takes; who by this, thou ſeeſt, is no Flatterer.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, all Sublunary Things, Ebb and Flow like the Waters. And, though Men may ſometimes enjoy a <hi>Spring</hi>-Tide of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; yet <hi>Fate</hi> has Hidden Sluces, which in a Moment, ſhall convey the Mighty Torrent to ſome other Channel.</p>
                  <p>I my ſelf have in ſome Meaſure experienc'd this, who am but a Puny in Compariſon with thee. Yet <hi>Deſtiny</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> are allotted to the <hi>Little,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Great.</hi> The <hi>Worm</hi> encounters as many croſs Contingencies, in her humble reptile State, as does the Towring <hi>Eagle,</hi> in all her lofty Flights and Ranges, through the wide-ſtretch'd Air.</p>
                  <p>In my <hi>Infancy</hi> I was ſnatch'd from the Cradle, and from the Arms of my Mournful Mother: Mournful on Two Accounts, the Death of a Husband, and the Neceſſity of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102962:14"/>parting with her Child. Yet this Early Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, turn'd to my Advantage, and her Comfort. The Sequel of my Good Fortune, invited her to forſake her <hi>Solitudes,</hi> and follow me to the <hi>Imperial</hi> City; where ſhe exchang'd her Melancholy Widow-Hood, for the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Love of a Merry <hi>Greek:</hi> Whilſt <hi>Fate</hi> had another Game to play with me; it being the Will of <hi>Heaven,</hi> That from the Delights of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the Honour of ſerving the <hi>Greateſt Sovereign</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> I ſhould fall into a Cruel <hi>Captivity,</hi> and be compelled Ignominiouſly to drudge for a <hi>Barbarous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel.</hi> Afterwards, I gain'd my <hi>Liberty,</hi> and apply'd my ſelf to ſtudy in the <hi>Academies.</hi> I will not boaſt of the Proficiency I made: But, at my Return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> thou knoweſt, my <hi>Superiors</hi> thought me capable, of doing the <hi>Port</hi> Service in this Place. Thus <hi>Providence</hi> ſports with <hi>Mortals,</hi> and by an Unaccountable Clew of Diſcipline, leads them through the Mazes of this Life.</p>
                  <p>How I have diſcharged my Truſt here, I dare Appeal to All; yet can pleaſe None. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man will be my <hi>Judge,</hi> to give <hi>Sentence</hi> againſt me; and ſome, I believe, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be my <hi>Executioners:</hi> Which, at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Times, carries me into ſo deep a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that I even join with my Enemies, and condemn my ſelf, though I know not for what. Surely, ſay I, ſo many perſpicaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men cannot be all in the Wrong, and I only in the Right: they muſt needs ſee ſome Faults in me, which I cannot diſcern
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102962:15"/>in my ſelf: doubtleſs I'm Partial, and never chang'd the Order of <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Wallet. Then I reflect on theſe Thoughts, as the mere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Melancholy: For, after the ſtricteſt Examination of my Conduct, I find my ſelf Innocent of thoſe Things, whereof I'm accus'd. Yet, whilſt I am juſtifying my Integrity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards my <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> my Sadneſs returns again, and tells me, That without Doubt, I have ſome Ways offended <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> who, for that Reaſon, ſuffer the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to perſecute me; and drive me into a more intimate and familiar Converſe with my ſelf, that ſo by making a frequent Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny after the Cauſe of my Outward Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I may diſcover the Secret Crimes, which I may have committed againſt <hi>Heaven,</hi> and which lie hid under my Inadvertence and Oblivion.</p>
                  <p>Then I'm fill'd with a Thouſand Scruples about my telling Lyes, and taking Falſe Oaths; though I'm diſpens'd with for all theſe Immoralities, by the <hi>Sovereign Arbiter</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> In a Word, I know not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times what to think. And, were it not, that my <hi>Agency</hi> in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> meets with ſome Succeſs, I ſhould often conclude, That I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie under ſome <hi>Curſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Charms</hi> of <hi>Men;</hi> That either <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> have a Peculiar Hand in Afflicting me.</p>
                  <p>But, all this may be only the Fumes of my own Diſtemper'd Spleen. And, the <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Judge</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> may paſs a Milder <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> on me, than either I do my ſelf, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102962:15"/>my Fellow-Mortals. He is Tranſcendently Benign and Merciful: And, our Sins of Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, appear in his Eyes, but as ſmall <hi>Atomes</hi> in the Rays of a Morning's Sun; which, though they be Innumerable, yet the leaſt Breath of Wind, blows them all out of Sight.</p>
                  <p>By what I have ſaid, 'tis apparent, that I have Regard both to thee and my ſelf: To thee, as the <hi>Supreme Dispoſer</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> under the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> to my ſelf, as one cull'd out for a <hi>Victim</hi> by the Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and lying at the Feet of thy Noble Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, begging thy Protection. My Enemies are Induſtrious to ruine me, and lay hold on all Opportunities to accompliſh it. The <hi>Sentence</hi> which they could not procure from thy <hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> they may hope to draw from thee by their Falſe Informations. This makes me uſe Pre-Caution in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; hoping to foreſtall their Malice, by this Humble Addreſs.</p>
                  <p>Imitate thou the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> and be not ſevere, in remarking the <hi>Peccadillo's</hi> and ſmall Delinquencies of thy <hi>Slave.</hi> If I turn <hi>Infidel</hi> or <hi>Traytor,</hi> I crave no Favour.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Supremely Merciful</hi> and <hi>Gracious,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and the <hi>Laſt</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> heap on thee as many Bleſſings every Day, as would employ my ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wiſhes a Thouſand Years; and grant, That thou mayſt find Admittance into the <hi>Place</hi> full of <hi>Rivers,</hi> whoſe <hi>Springs</hi> take

                  <p>THE <hi>Troubles</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which a while ago ſeem'd to be compos'd, are now again broke out afreſh. The Private Grudges of Some, and the Ambition of Others of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> have once more put all in Arms. This City is Block'd up by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Army, who has not been long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Flanders.</hi> The King, the Queen, with <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> and the whole <hi>Court,</hi> are at <hi>St. Germains en Lay,</hi> whither they went by Night. This abrupt Departure, gave freſh Courage to the <hi>Seditious,</hi> and at the ſame Time, furniſh'd them with new Matter of Accuſation againſt <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> who, they ſay, has ſtole away their <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> from them. The <hi>Parliament</hi> have declar'd him, an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>Government.</hi> They are levying Soldiers as faſt as they can; and Proviſions are laid in, as if they were to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102962:16"/>ſuſtain a long Siege. Several <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Grandees,</hi> are come over to the <hi>Citizens,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſerted the <hi>Court;</hi> among whom, is the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conty,</hi> Brother to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi> Yet the <hi>Pariſians</hi> are diſtruſtful of him, and have Conſin'd his Siſter, as a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage for his Fidelity; not knowing, that his Deſertion is Real, being occaſion'd by ſome Quarrel between him and his Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, That <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> has taken a Reſolution to depart the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that ſo he may avoid the Tempeſt that threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him from all Hands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> has ſent Orders to the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,</hi> that ſerve under <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> commanding them to abandon that <hi>General,</hi> who, they ſay, has declared for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſent to offer them his Service.</p>
                  <p>On the other Side, the <hi>Citizens</hi> endeavour to ſtrengthen their <hi>Party,</hi> by ſending to all the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> to deſire their Conjunction, in eſpouſing the Quarrel of this of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Companies which the <hi>Burghers</hi> of this City have rais'd, wear this <hi>Motto</hi> in their <hi>Enſigns,</hi> WE SEEK OUR KING.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> keeps near the Frontiers of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> with an Army of Twenty Thouſand Men; and ſends frequent Propoſals to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in Order to a <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was writing the laſt Word,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102962:17"/>News was brought me, That <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> is ſeiz'd, and clapt in Priſon at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> which Place is in the King's Hands. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn the Reaſon of his Confinement, but am apt to ſuſpect, 'tis on the Score of his late appearing among the Rabble of <hi>Paris,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I gave an Account in a Letter to the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Surprize I am in at this Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Accident, puts me upon a Thouſand Thoughts. I know not what Courſe to take for my own Safety. If <hi>Eliachim</hi>'s Papers ſhould be ſearch'd, <hi>Mahmut</hi> muſt be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd; and then, if I tarry in the City, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape a Priſon: For, tho' at this Juncture, one would think this Place, a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the <hi>Court;</hi> yet the Hatred they bear to the <hi>True Believers,</hi> and the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſo Important a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> as mine, would ſuperſede their Inteſtine Animoſities. I ſhould infallibly be either deliver'd up to the <hi>Court,</hi> or ſent to the <hi>Baſtile.</hi> If I go out of the City, my Danger is yet greater; all the Paſſes of the Country, being narrowly watch'd, and ſtrongly guarded by the King's Soldiers. This made me at firſt, reſolve to deferr the Concluſion of this Letter to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time, whilſt I provided for my own Safety; as thinking it impoſſible, to convey any Intelligence out of <hi>France</hi> undiſcover'd. But being inform'd of a <hi>Courier,</hi> that was juſt going from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and fearing leſt I ſhould never have the Privilege of Pen, Ink and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102962:17"/>Paper again, I have raviſh'd a few Moments, from that little Time I have left to ſhift for my ſelf, that ſo I might give thee Notice of this Accident.</p>
                  <p>I have written alſo to <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi</hi> at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to prevent any <hi>Diſpatches</hi> from him, till farther Order. Both theſe Letters I venture in the Hands of a faithful Meſſenger, who has cauſed them to be ſew'd up in the Heels of his Shooes, to prevent Diſcovery. He travels under the Protection of the <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not a Minute left to ſay more, than that I am at this Inſtant parting from my Lodging; my Books and other Things being packt up, and Porters ready to carry 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. If I get ſafe out of the Houſe, I muſt change my Habit and Name; and ſo lay the Foundation of a New Concealment, till the Iſſue of this Adventure, ſhall direct me what to do.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, Illuſtrious <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> and expect to hear more in my Next; or, let my Silence convince thee, that <hi>Mahmut</hi> is no longer at Liberty.</p>

Thy Brother <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim,</hi> is arreſted by the King's Orders. What is laid to his Charge, I know not for certain: Neither is it neceſſary for thee, to be inform'd in that Point. But, if his Confinement be owing to ſome Services he has lately done me, we are all loſt. His Papers will be ſearch'd, which muſt of Neceſſity betray our Secrets: And then, we have Nothing to expect, but the ſevereſt Execution of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Fury and Revenge. I am in no ſmall Confuſion at this Accident, having ſcarce Time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for my Concealment. Send no more to <hi>Paris,</hi> till thou receiveſt farther Advice. We are all in Arms, this City being block'd up by the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Troops; ſo that I know not well which way to ſhift for my ſelf, and eſcape a Thouſand Scrutinies, which they will every where make into the Affairs of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But, that <hi>Fate</hi> which over-rules Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Contingencies, will, I hope, reſcue me out of this Danger: To which I commend both thee and me; bidding thee Farewel, as

At Length I have found one, wherein I hope to meet with no <hi>Malevolent Aſpects,</hi> but to remain as before, in a <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conjunction</hi> with the <hi>Moon;</hi> behind whoſe Splendors, I may lie cover'd, from the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of peering Mortals.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak more Intelligibly, I am for the Preſent, remov'd to other Lodgings in this City, the better to ſhelter my ſelf from the Storm which ſeems to hang over my Head,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102962:19"/>ſince <hi>Eliachim</hi> was ſeiz'd. Yeſterday, I wrote to the <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> and to <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi,</hi> to give them an Account of this Accident. This goes along with the ſame Meſſenger; for, I durſt not confide in the <hi>Poſts,</hi> during the Preſent Diſorders of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I receiv'd a Letter from thee, wherein thou informeſt me, of an Attempt that has been lately made, to rob the <hi>Treaſury</hi> of <hi>Venice:</hi> Which, according to thy Deſcription, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rich and Magnificent; not to be match'd in <hi>Europe.</hi> Perhaps, if thou hadſt ſeen the Wealth that is preſerv'd in the <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Denis,</hi> a City not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> thou wouldſt be of another Mind. But neither of us can make proper Compariſons, having not ſeen both Places. The <hi>French</hi> extol the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſay, it far exceeds that of <hi>Venice.</hi> But, they may ſpeak Partially; it being the Humour of all People, to magnify the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of their own Nation: And, the <hi>French</hi> come not ſhort of the Reſt of the World in Vain-Glory. However it be, it was a vaſt Attempt, and full of Infinite Difficulties and Perils, to Rob the Vaults of a <hi>Church,</hi> in the Heart of that Great and Populous City, where all the Riches of the <hi>Seigniory</hi> were Repoſited. It is an Argument of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Souls, who durſt undertake ſo hazardous an Enterprize.</p>
                  <p>But, this is not the Firſt Time the <hi>Venetians</hi> have been in Danger, to loſe that Prodigious Maſs of Wealth. A Poor <hi>Grecian</hi> once found a Way, through Marble Barricado's under-Ground,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102962:19"/>to enter thoſe Golden Cells; from whence he carried away, to the Value of Twenty Hundred Thouſand <hi>Zechins</hi> in Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. But, making one of his Countrymen acquainted with it, the Villain betray'd him to the <hi>Doge,</hi> who cauſed him to be Hang'd.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> has been all along ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Happy in Diſcovery of <hi>Plots,</hi> and other Miſchiefs intended againſt Her. I know not whether thou haſt heard, of the Famous <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy</hi> of <hi>Tiepoli;</hi> who not content with the Life and Eſtate of a <hi>Private Gentleman,</hi> ſought to render himſelf <hi>Sovereign</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> And, to this End, inſinuated into the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of many Thouſands of the Citizens; whom he kept in conſtant Penſion for above Nine Years together, under the Notion of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting him, to revenge certain Injuries he had receiv'd from a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman. They were all to run with their Arms into the Streets, when they ſhould hear the Name <hi>Tie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli</hi> utter'd aloud, and often repeated.</p>
                  <p>But, when the Day was come, whereon he was to put his Deſigns in Execution, and the Alarm was given in the Streets, and Old Woman made ſuch Haſte to look out at her Chamber-Window, to ſee what was the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Tumult, that ſhe threw down an Earthen Veſſel; which falling directly on the Head of <hi>Tiepoli,</hi> Kill'd him, and ſo put an End to the <hi>Rebellion.</hi> For which happy Accident, the <hi>Senate</hi> ſetled a Yearly Penſion of a Thouſand <hi>Zechins,</hi> on the Old Woman during her Life, and the ſame to be paid
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102962:20"/>to her Heirs and Poſterity for ever.</p>
                  <p>Send me no <hi>Diſpatches,</hi> till thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd another Letter from me, which will direct thee what to do.</p>

They ſay, 'tis a ſufficient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Piety, to relieve the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Men; and, that it is but a Fruitleſs Hypocriſy, to ſhew Kindneſs to the Brutes, who, in their Opinion, have neither Souls nor Reaſon, and conſequently are Inſenſible of our Good Offices toward them.</p>

                  <p>Theſe <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> ſay, That the Firſt Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth, for above Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, liv'd altogether on the <hi>Vegetable Products;</hi> of which they Offer'd the <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> It being eſteem'd an Inexpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wickedneſs, to ſhed the <hi>Blood</hi> of any <hi>Animal,</hi> though it were in <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> much more to Eat of their Fleſh. To this End,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102962:21"/>they relate the Firſt Slaughter of a <hi>Bull,</hi> to have been made at <hi>Athens,</hi> on this Occaſion. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Diomus,</hi> as he was making the Accuſtomed <hi>Oblation</hi> of <hi>Fruits</hi> on an <hi>Altar</hi> in the <hi>Open Field</hi> (for, as yet they had no <hi>Temples</hi>) a <hi>Bull</hi> came running from the Herd, which was grazing hard by, and eat of the Conſecrated Herbage. Upon which, <hi>Diomus</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> mov'd with Zeal at the Reputed <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> and ſnatching a Sword from one of thoſe that were preſent, kill'd the <hi>Bull.</hi> But, when his Paſſion was over, and he conſider'd, what a heinous Crime he had committed; fearing alſo the Rage of the People, he perſuaded them, That a <hi>God</hi> had appear'd to him, and commanded him to Offer that <hi>Bull</hi> in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> by Burning his Fleſh with Fire on the <hi>Altar,</hi> as an Atonement for his devouring the <hi>Conſecrated</hi> Fruits. The Devout Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, acquieſc'd to the Words of their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as to an <hi>Oracle.</hi> And, the <hi>Bull</hi> being flea'd, and Fire laid on the <hi>Altar,</hi> they all aſſiſted at the New <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> From which Time, the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> was Yearly obſerv'd among the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> to <hi>Sacrifice</hi> a Bull. And by them, this Method of <hi>Religious Cruelty,</hi> was taught not only to all <hi>Greece,</hi> but to the Reſt of the World. In Proceſs of Time, a certain <hi>Prieſt,</hi> in the Midſt of his Bloody <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> taking up a Piece of the Broiled Fleſh, which had fall'n from the <hi>Altar</hi> on the Ground, and burning his Fingers therewith, ſuddainly clapt them to his Mouth, to mitigate the Pain. But,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102962:22"/>when he had once taſted the Sweetneſs of the Fat, not only long'd for more of it, but gave a Piece to his Aſſiſtant, and he to others: Who all pleaſed with the new-found Dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fell to Eating of Fleſh greedily. And hence this <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Gluttony,</hi> was taught to other <hi>Mortals.</hi> Neither is it Material, what the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> object againſt theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, when they introduce the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Sacrificing</hi> Living Creatures, in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> ſince, thou knoweſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Errors are Inſerted in the <hi>Written Law,</hi> from whence they take this Story.</p>
                  <p>They ſay alſo, That the Firſt <hi>Goat</hi> that fell by the Hands of Men, was kill'd in Revenge for the Injuries it had done the Owner of a Vineyard, in browſing on his Vines; ſuch an Impious Deed, having never been heard of before.</p>
                  <p>This is certain, That the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Wiſeſt and moſt Ancient People in the World, having receiv'd from the Firſt Inhabitants of the Earth a <hi>Tradition,</hi> forbidding Men, <hi>To Kill any Living Creature;</hi> to give the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Force to this <hi>Primitive Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> they Form'd the <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Gods,</hi> in the <hi>Similitude</hi> of <hi>Beaſts:</hi> That ſo the Vulgar, ſtruck with Reverence at the <hi>Sacred Symbols,</hi> might learn to abſtain from <hi>Killing,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>Hurting</hi> the <hi>Dumb Animals;</hi> under whoſe <hi>Forms,</hi> they Repreſented whatſoever among them was eſteem'd Adorable.</p>
                  <p>Yet, leſt any in his Life-Time, ſhould by Accident, or otherwiſe, have tranſgreſs'd the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102962:22"/>
                     <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> they uſed a kind of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> after this Manner. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> took the Bowels out of the Belly of the Deceaſed, and putting them in an Earthen Veſſel, they held it toward the Sun; and calling Witneſſes, they made the following <hi>Speech,</hi> in Behalf of the <hi>Dead:</hi> 
                     <q>O thou <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe <hi>Empire</hi> is <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> and all ye Other <hi>Powers,</hi> who give <hi>Life</hi> to <hi>Men,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive me into the Society of the <hi>Immortal Gods.</hi> For, ſo long as I lived in this World, I Religiouſly perſevered in the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of thoſe <hi>Deities,</hi> which were made known to me by my <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> I always <hi>Honour'd</hi> my <hi>Parents,</hi> who begat my <hi>Body.</hi> I never <hi>Kill'd</hi> any <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Beaſt,</hi> nor have been Guilty of any Black Crime. But, if whilſt I liv'd I have treſpaſs'd, in <hi>Taſting</hi> any of thoſe <hi>Things</hi> which are <hi>Forbidden;</hi> it was not my Sin, but the Fault of theſe Entrails, which are here ſeparated from the reſt of my Body.</q> And having ſaid this, they caſt the Veſſel into the River, on the Banks of which, the <hi>Ceremony</hi> was perform'd; Embalming the Reſt of the Body, as Pure and free from Sin.</p>
                  <p>After the ſame Manner, the <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> or <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> practiſed <hi>Abſtinence.</hi> And, to imprint in their <hi>Diſciples,</hi> a Tenderneſs and Friendſhip toward the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, according to their different Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either Lyons, Hyaena's, Crows, Eagles, Hawks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, their <hi>Garments</hi> were <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> all over, with the Various <hi>Figures</hi> of

                     <hi>Animals;</hi> thereby inſinuating, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Soul's Tranſmigration;</hi> and inculcating this <hi>Myſtery, That the Spirit of Man, enters ſucceſſively into all Sorts of Bodies:</hi> Which, thou knoweſt, is not remote from the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>True Believers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would not be amiſs, as a Teſtimony of the Practice of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> to inſert a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Addreſs,</hi> which the <hi>Reformed Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> were wont to make before the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> 
                     <q>O <hi>Divine Governor</hi> of the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cities,</hi> we have led a Holy Life, from the Time that we were Initiated in thy <hi>Myſteries,</hi> and forſook the <hi>Nocturnal Rites,</hi> and <hi>Bloody Feaſts</hi> of <hi>Bacchus:</hi> We are now Purified, and Clothe our ſelves in <hi>White Veſtments,</hi> the <hi>Emblems</hi> of our <hi>Innocence:</hi> We ſhun the Society of polluted Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; neither approach we to the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> nor <hi>Taſte</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of any <hi>Thing,</hi> which has been endued with <hi>Life.</hi>

                  <p>Such alſo was of Old, and to this Day is, the <hi>Abſtinence</hi> of the <hi>Indians;</hi> among whom, the <hi>Brachmans</hi> perform the Office of <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> Theſe, the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> called <hi>Gymnoſophiſts.</hi> They are all of one <hi>Race,</hi> neither will they admit a Stranger into their <hi>Order.</hi> They live for the moſt Part near to <hi>Ganges,</hi> or ſome other River, for the Sake of their frequent <hi>Purifications.</hi> Their Diet conſiſts, of Milk Curdl'd with ſowre Herbs. They feed alſo on Apples, Rice, and other Fruits of the Earth; eſteeming it the

They live in little Hutts or Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, every one by himſelf, avoiding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Diſcourſe; employing all their Time in Contemplation, and the Service of the <hi>Temple.</hi> They eſteem this Life, but a Neceſſary Diſpenſation of <hi>Nature,</hi> which they Voluntarily undergo as a Penance; ardently thirſting, after the Diſſolution of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and firmly believing, That the <hi>Soul</hi> by Death, is releaſed from its Priſon, and laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches forth into Immenſe Liberty and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Therefore they are always chearfully diſpoſed to Die, bewailing thoſe that are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and Celebrating the Funerals of the Dead, with joyful Solemnities and Triumphs. Among their Good Works, it is accounted an Act of great Reputation and Virtue, to build <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> for <hi>Beaſts</hi> as well as <hi>Men:</hi> And, in every City, there are great Numbers of ſuch, as ſpend all their Life, in tending on Sick and Wounded Animals, or ſuch as have no Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance elſewhere.

                  <p>I could relate to thee, Examples of <hi>Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> in the Ancient <hi>Lacedaemonians, Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Jews,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> Nor are there wanting ſome Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of it, in theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts.

                  </p>
                  <p>By all which it is Evident, That the tender Regard which the <hi>True Faithful</hi> have for the <hi>Brutes,</hi> is no <hi>Innovation,</hi> or ſingular <hi>Caprice</hi> of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> but the <hi>Primitive Practice</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> the <hi>

                  <p>I Am return'd to my former Lodging again, the Caſe of <hi>Eliachim,</hi> being not ſo bad as my Fears. The Occaſion of his Confinement, were certain Words he ſpoke againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> and the <hi>Court,</hi> in Company of ſuch as were Officious to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige that <hi>Miniſter.</hi> This was done at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> not far from <hi>Paris;</hi> where they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cauſed him to be taken into Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the King's <hi>Guards,</hi> who quarter'd in that Town. It has coſt him a conſiderable Sum of Money, to purchaſe his Liberty; which he now enjoys, as before. I had other Thoughts, when I firſt heard the News of his being ſeized; and that it was, for ſome Seditious Expreſſions: For then I call'd to Mind, how he had Acted laſt Year by my Order, during the <hi>Tumults</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> and concluded, That ſome Unlucky Accident had now betray'd him. Which if it were ſo, would infallibly bring me into the ſame Danger. This made me ſo ſuddainly change my Habitation, and put a Stop to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches</hi> of the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> I thought no Caution too much, to preſerve the Affairs of my <hi>Commiſſion</hi> Indemnified; and, that it were better to offend, in being too Wary, than too Secure. If I have taken wrong
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102962:25"/>Meaſures in thus abſconding, 'tis for want of fuller Inſtruction from my <hi>Superiors.</hi> I wiſh they would honour me with Particular Rules, in Caſe of ſuch Emergencies: Then I ſhould ſteer my Courſe, without running the Hazard of Rocks or Sands. I have often deſir'd to know, Whether, if I were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, I ſhould own my ſelf an <hi>Agent</hi> for the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> But none of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> have vouchſafed to direct me in this Point: Whereby, I may commit an irreparable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, if ſuch a Thing ſhould happen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adonai</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> informs me of an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt lately made to rob the <hi>Treaſury</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> which, according to his Deſcription, is very Rich and Magnificent. He ſays, there are Twelve <hi>Crowns</hi> of pure Gold, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Number of Breaſt-plates of the ſame Metal, ſet with all Sorts of precious Stones of Ineſtimable Value: A Hundred Veſſels of Agat: Threeſcore <hi>Services</hi> for the <hi>Altar,</hi> all of pure Gold, enrich'd with Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, Sapphires, Emralds, and other Stones of Price. There is alſo an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn</hi>'s Horn, above the Purchaſe of Money. There are Fourteen Unpoliſh'd Pearls, as large as a Man's Fiſt. The <hi>Ducal</hi> Cap, is valued at a Hundred Thouſand <hi>Zechins:</hi> With many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rareties and Coſtly Ornaments, too tedious to be inſerted in a Letter.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, ſo much Wealth, was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to fall into the Hands of Little Private <hi>Thieves:</hi> It is a Booty, fit for <hi>Kings</hi> and great <hi>Generals,</hi> the Licens'd <hi>Banditi</hi> of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102962:26"/>Earth. So many Glittering Jewels, would tempt the Honeſty of an <hi>Angel:</hi> And, he would be glad to adorn the Apartments of his <hi>Heaven,</hi> with theſe Radiant Drops of the Sun, which he ſees on Earth.</p>
                  <p>I have met with ſome pretty Relations of the Boldneſs of <hi>Robbers,</hi> but none that ever match'd the Bravery of this Enterprize; which was no leſs, than to Rob one of the moſt Potent <hi>States</hi> in the World, of her Chiefeſt Treaſure.</p>
                  <p>He wanted not for Impudence, who, when the <hi>Emperor Charles</hi> V. was removing his <hi>Court,</hi> and all the <hi>Officers</hi> were buſy in pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Goods, enter'd the Chamber where the <hi>Emperor</hi> was; and having made his Obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, fell roundly to pulling down the rich Hangings of <hi>Tiſſue,</hi> which by the Help of his Confederates, he carried away, with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Plate: No Body ever ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that he was one of the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Servants, till the Perſon came, whoſe Office it was to remove thoſe Goods, and then the other was known to be a Thief.</p>
                  <p>I have heard of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who, on a Great <hi>Feſtival,</hi> when the <hi>Prieſts</hi> had finiſh'd the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and were retir'd to their Lodgings, went very boldly and took the Golden Veſſels off the <hi>Altar,</hi> and carry'd them away under his Cloak, as though he had been the <hi>Steward</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> no Body ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other.</p>
                  <p>I kiſs the Hem of thy Veſt, Illuſtrious <hi>Kai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macham,</hi> and pray, that thou may'ſt mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize

                  <p>NOW thou may'ſt continue thy <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches</hi> as before. Our Fears are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd: <hi>Eliachim</hi> is releas'd, and all Things are in Safety. Thou haſt no Reaſon to tax me with Timorouſneſs, in ſo abruptly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking my Habitation, on the bare Foreſight of far-fetch'd Poſſibilities; when thou ſhalt conſider, that there is no arming againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies in the Moment they arrive, and that he who truſts all Things to <hi>Chance,</hi> makes a Lottery of his Life, wherein, for One Happy Event, he ſhall meet with Ten Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Ones. To what Uſe ſerves that <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Faculty,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> has poſted as the <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> of our Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, allowing it the Sences for Scouts and Sentinells? To what End, I ſay, ſerves this <hi>Watchful Faculty,</hi> but to take the Alarm at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102962:27"/>doubtful Emergencies; to rouze our Caution, that ſo we may make Proviſion, and be in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Defence, againſt whatſoever may happen?</p>
                  <p>News came, that <hi>Eliachim</hi> was ſeiz'd, for Seditious Words againſt the Government. I was conſcious, that both he and I, had been Guilty of more than bare Words in that Kind. Therefore, what had happen'd to him, I look'd upon as due to my ſelf alſo; and, that my Confinement would ſoon follow, if I took not ſpeedy Care to prevent it, by ſeaſonably abſconding. This was the Reaſon of my ſudden Departure, which cannot juſtly be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd to Cowardiſe, ſince 'twas the Effect of Common Prudence.</p>
                  <p>Now I'm return'd to my Old <hi>Lodging</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, where the Joy they are in for the Birth of a Son, will not give them Leiſure to reflect on my Affairs: So that I am receiv'd by my <hi>Hoſt,</hi> without the leaſt Jealouſie or ſuſpicious Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions. Brim-full of Mirth and Jovial Thougts, the Good Man Compliments me, and proclaims his better Fortune: Invites me to ſit down with his Friends, and partake of the Gifts of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> This thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, is the Cuſtom of the whole Earth, at the Birth of Mortals. They make merry over one, that is born to the ſame Miſeries as themſelves; who, the firſt Moment he draws the <hi>Breath</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> is enrolled in the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of <hi>Death;</hi> and from the <hi>Womb,</hi> makes ſwift and direct Advances to the <hi>Grave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, I ſate down with the Reſt, to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102962:27"/>comply with the exhilarated Humour of my <hi>Hoſt.</hi> I eat, drank, and ſeem'd Merry with the Company. Yet, at the ſame Time, I could not but nauſeate my Entertainment, and diſdain the extravagant Profuſion of Spirit, which appear'd in every one of this vain Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. They all talk'd eagerly; and, one Man's Words, drown'd thoſe of another: Whilſt an Univerſal Laughter, confounded the Sence of all. Then I prais'd in my ſelf, the Modeſty and Order obſerv'd in our <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Banquets and Feaſts, where no uncomely Geſtures or Actions, eſcape the well-nurtur'd Gueſts; no loud talking or Braying like Aſſes, but every one ſtrives to ſuppreſs the Motions and Appearances of a too forward and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Mirth, and contain themſelves within the Bounds of a decent and civil Reſerve. Such were the Feaſts inſtituted by <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> among the Ancient <hi>Lacedaemonians;</hi> where, ſuch as were Friends and Acquaintance, met together and refreſh'd themſelves, without Riot and Luxury. They convers'd together interchangeably, after the Manner of <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> or Men of the <hi>Law:</hi> Diſcourſing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly either of <hi>Natural</hi> Things, or <hi>Civil</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs: Mixing facetious and witty Jeſts, with their more ſerious Talk, without Clamour, Scurrility or giving any Offence. But, theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> People, think themſelves not Merry till they are Drunk, nor Witty unleſs they be Rude. They play a Thouſand Wanton Tricks, like Apes; and, the greateſt Buffoon, is the beſt Company.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102962:28"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>In former Times, there was a <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Marble,</hi> ſtanding on the Top of a Mountain in <hi>Apulia,</hi> with this <hi>Inſcription</hi> on the <hi>Head,</hi> which was of <hi>Braſs, ON MAY-DAY AT
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102962:28"/>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N-RISING, I SHALL HAVE A HEAD OF GOLD.</hi> No Man in all thoſe Parts could be found, who was able to unrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this Myſterious Expreſſion; and therefore, it was not regarded for many Ages. But at length, in the Reign of a certain <hi>Prince,</hi> there was a <hi>Saracen,</hi> who having ſeen and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Statue,</hi> with the <hi>Inſcription,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to explain it for a certain Reward. The <hi>Prince</hi> hearing of this, and being greedy of the Novelty, ſent for the <hi>Saracen;</hi> and bargain'd with him for a Thouſand Crowns, to unfold this Riddle. He waited till <hi>May-Day</hi> came, and watching the <hi>Image</hi> that Morning Early, he obſerv'd the Place where the <hi>Head</hi> caſt its Shadow, juſt as the Sun roſe. There he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd certain Men to dig: Which when they had done, and were got pretty deep in the Earth, they encounter'd a Prodigious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Silver, Gold, and Jewels. With which the <hi>Prince</hi> was ſo well ſatisfy'd, that he doubl'd the <hi>Saracens</hi> Reward, and ſent him Home into his own Country, laden with rich Preſents. Doubtleſs, there is much Wealth bury'd by Men in the Earth. For, in Former Times, they were of Opinion, That if they ſhould die ſuddainly, in the Wars or otherwiſe, ſuch Riches as they had hidden in the Earth, would ſerve them in the <hi>Other World.</hi> And this is the Practice of the <hi>Indians</hi> to this Day; as my Brother informs me, who has been among them.</p>
                  <p>Strange Blindneſs! that Men ſhould think the <hi>Immortal Soul,</hi> needed the Aſſiſtance of

                  <p>But, I believe, there is a greater Myſtery, in the Reconciliation between the <hi>French-Court</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi> Some Ends of Policy, have haſten'd both <hi>Parties</hi> to clap up a <hi>Peace,</hi> while the ſecret Rancour remains unpurg'd.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the Union of ſo many <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> with the <hi>Parliament,</hi> might incline the <hi>Queen</hi> to milder Counſels, than her own <hi>Spaniſh Genius.</hi> Beſides, the Conjunction of the other <hi>Parliaments</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the Revolt of <hi>Normandy, Gaſcoigne</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> with many Eminent Cities, were very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Motives.

                  <p>Whatever were the Inducements, a <hi>Peace</hi> was concluded about the latter End of the Third <hi>Moon,</hi> at a Place call'd <hi>Ruel,</hi> not far from <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King has a <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> ſeated in the Midſt of a little <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> In one of my Letters to the <hi>Kaima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham,</hi> I formerly deſcrib'd the King's <hi>Houſe</hi> and <hi>Garden,</hi> at St. <hi>German en Lay.</hi> This is but a little <hi>Chioſc</hi> or Bower, in Compariſon of that Stately <hi>Palace.</hi> Yet what is wanting in the Grandeur of the Fabrick, is ſupply'd in its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legant Contrivance, and the Richneſs of its Ornaments. And, as for the <hi>Garden,</hi> it comes not far ſhort of the other; there being in it all Manner of curious Water-works, Groves, Solitudes, Fountains, Statues, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102962:30"/>the Ingenuity of theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Artiſts could ſuggeſt, as proper to render this Place agreeable to the Melancholy Humour of the late Queen-Mother, <hi>Mary de Medicis,</hi> to whom it belong'd during her Life.</p>
                  <p>When you enter this delicious <hi>Eden,</hi> your Eyes and Ears are preſently deceiv'd, by the Counterfeit Notes and Motions of all kinds of Birds, which perpetually Sing, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tunes their Throats. A little farther, you ſee ſeveral old Gentile Statues, adorning Two Fountains: And, among the reſt, a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> big as the Life; who by the Harmony he makes, ſeems to have a Conſort of Muſick in his Belly, as Regular and Sweet, as that of the <hi>Italian</hi> Society at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which thou haſt often heard.</p>
                  <p>As we depart from this, full of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Admiration at the Exquiſite Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Nature</hi> in theſe Contrivances, we fall inſenſibly into a Place exactly like what the <hi>Poets</hi> deſcribe when they ſpeak of <hi>Elyſium.</hi> It is a Grove, the Tops of whoſe Trees are ſo thick interwoven, that the Sun appears no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe through them, than as if he were behind a Cloud or in an <hi>Eclipſe.</hi> So that the Darkneſs of this Place, and ſolemn Murmur the Winds make on high among the Tops of the Trees, fills it with a Kind of <hi>Sacred</hi> Horror. Which has often made me think this <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> ſomething like that which <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> deſcribe, when they ſpeak of the <hi>Avenues</hi> to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jupiter Ammon</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For, in the very Center of this <hi>Grove,</hi>

                  <p>I could not forbear making this Digreſſion, when I mention'd <hi>Ruel</hi> to be the Place where the <hi>Peace</hi> was concluded, between the <hi>Court</hi> and the <hi>Parliament.</hi> This <hi>Encomium,</hi> is a Tribute which I ow'd, for the Satisfaction and Pleaſure I have often receiv'd in this Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>The <hi>Coadjutor</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> who is an <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> is highly affronted, that this <hi>Peace</hi> was concluded without him, who had a chief Hand in beginning the War. He labours to inflame the People again, and reduce all to the old Confuſion, being an Irreconcileable Enemy of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini.</hi> So that we expect another Inſurrection in a ſhort Time: For the <hi>French</hi> cannot be long Idle.</p>
                  <p>Happy <hi>Miniſter,</hi> I leave thee under the Wings of that <hi>Spirit</hi> which guards the <hi>Elect,</hi> and bid thee Farewel.</p>

                  <p>SHall I tell thee, I mourn for the Death of our Friend <hi>Egry Boinou,</hi> whom thou ſayeſt, a <hi>Fever</hi> ſnatch'd from us the Firſt Day of the <hi>Moon Regib?</hi> That <hi>Fever,</hi> it ſeems, was the Effect of his continual and exceſſive Grief for the Loſs of his Eyes; ſo that we may ſay, he has been dying ever ſince the Hour that Fatal <hi>Sentence</hi> was put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. And, ſhall we grudge our Friend a Releaſe from ſo lingring a Death? At beſt, it was but the <hi>Winter</hi> of Life, wrapt up in Clouds and Darkneſs: Now like the <hi>Serpent,</hi> he has caſt his Slough, lifts up his Head with new Vigor, ſports himſelf in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and basks in the Warmth of an Eternal <hi>Spring.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Twill not therefore be a Mark of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, but only a Diſcovery of our Self-Love, to condole the Occaſion of His Happineſs, becauſe it has leſſen'd Ours, by robbing us of his beloved Company and Friendſhip. Beſides, we know not, but that he may ſtill continue to be our Friend, even in that <hi>Inviſible State;</hi> and either manage our Intereſts <hi>Above,</hi> or at leaſt protect us from Dangers here <hi>Below.</hi> We are ignorant of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102962:31"/>of <hi>Spirits;</hi> and, for ought we know, the <hi>Souls</hi> of juſt Men after Death, may become the <hi>Tutelar Genii,</hi> or <hi>Guardian Angels</hi> of their Surviving Friends and Relations. Let it be how it will, doubtleſs <hi>Egry</hi> is Immortal and Happy; and, 'twill be Envy in us, to repine at it. Rather let us congratulate the Time of his Deceaſe, as the Day of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; and leave <hi>Mourning,</hi> to the Crowd of Mortals, who do a Thouſand Things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever thinking what they are about. They tread in the Steps of their Fathers, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining, whether they be Right or Wrong: Cuſtom and Education have almoſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Reaſon from the Earth. Is it not a pleaſant Spectacle, to ſee the Kindred of an Old Rich <hi>Miſer</hi> (for whoſe Death they had long waited, like <hi>Harpies</hi> for their Prey) now flock about his Lifeleſs Carcaſe, howling out a Thouſand forc'd Lamentations; whilſt in the mean Time, their Blood dances in their Veins for Joy? Yet however, this carries a Shew of Civiliz'd Manners, and is better than the Barbarous Cuſtom of the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Maſſagetes,</hi> who when their Old Men grew Uſeleſs and Troubleſome, were wont to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them, and make a Banquet with their Fleſh; or the <hi>Thebarenes,</hi> who threw their Aged Friends alive down Precipices. Theſe were Salvages: But, much more ſo were the <hi>Hircanians</hi> and <hi>Bactrians,</hi> who caſt their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Parents yet living, to be devour'd by Dogs: Which Inhumanity when <hi>Staſanor,</hi> the <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:102962:32"/>to ſuppreſs, they had like to have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd him from the <hi>Government:</hi> So prevalent is the Force of a Receiv'd Cuſtom, on the Minds of the Unthinking Herd.</p>
                  <p>Let thou and I therefore, not ſupinely take up with Common Practices; but, like Men of Reaſon, let us adjuſt the Laſt Offices we owe to our Friend, whilſt we pour forth ſome Devout <hi>Oraiſons</hi> for the Health of his Soul, without diſturbing his and our own Repoſe, with fruitleſs Lamentations. And, ſince we are bereav'd of his Society on Earth, let us prepare to follow him, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ſelves agreeable Company at our next Rendezvous in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was an Unjuſtifiable Rigor in <hi>Sultan I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim,</hi> to deprive him of his Eyes, becauſe he had only caſt 'em unhappily on one of the <hi>Sultana's,</hi> as ſhe enter'd the Garden. This Jealouſy, is the peculiar Vice of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Yet they are more ſevere in <hi>Perſia,</hi> where 'tis preſent Death, to be within Two Leagues of the <hi>King</hi>'s Women, when they travel the Road. But, I never knew, that <hi>Eunuchs</hi> were thus puniſh'd. Or, is there ſuch a Difference between a <hi>White</hi> and a <hi>Black Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,</hi> That the <hi>One</hi> deſerves to loſe his Eyes for beholding that by Chance, which the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> is honourably rewarded for having Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to, and ſeldom being out of their Sight?</p>
                  <p>This was the worſt Puniſhment that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi> the <hi>Law-Giver</hi> of the <hi>Locrians,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on them that were Actually caught in Adultery. Which puts me in Mind of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102962:32"/>Inſtance of this Man's Juſtice: For, when his own Son was accus'd, and prov'd Guilty of this Crime; at once to ſhew the <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of a <hi>Father,</hi> and the Incorruptible <hi>Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of a <hi>Judge,</hi> he firſt caus'd One of his own Eyes to be put out, and then One of his Sons: Thus taking on himſelf, <hi>Half</hi> the Penalty; that ſo, the <hi>Law</hi> might be ſatisfy'd in the <hi>Whole,</hi> and yet his Son not be Totally depriv'd of his Sight.</p>
                  <p>Thou telleſt me no News of our Armies, nor what Alterations have been made amongſt the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> ſince the Death of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim.</hi> We have various Reports here; and ſome ſay, that the New <hi>Vizir A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem</hi> will be no long-liv'd Man. I deſire thee, to write often to me, and ſend me what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thou can'ſt.</p>
                  <p>Let nothing ſlip the Knot, which has faſt'ned us ſo many Years together, in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Friendſhip: But, let us carry that <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> with us to our Graves; that, at what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſoever we may be buried, our <hi>Souls</hi> may by the Force of that Attractive, find one another out, and converſe together, in that <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Shadows.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Captain Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>I Know not where this Letter will find thee; on the Shore, or at Sea. If thou art in the <hi>Watry Wilderneſs,</hi> I have no Art to trace thee. There are no certain Roads in that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant</hi> Element. It is a mighty Plain, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Path or Track. And though there be certain Stages in it, yet thy Arrival at them, is tim'd at the Pleaſure of the Winds and Waves, which will not obey even the <hi>Orders</hi> thou haſt received from the <hi>Grand Signior, Lord</hi> of the <hi>Four Seas.</hi> Perhaps, thou art in purſuit of ſome <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships, or other <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Veſſels, the <hi>Corſairs</hi> of the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean.</hi> Or, thou mayſt be Careening thy Fleet, in the ſecurer Retreats of the <hi>Archipelago.</hi> Thou may'ſt be within a Minute of a Wreck, or juſt entring a Harbor. Wherever thou art, may <hi>Heaven</hi> preſerve thee from the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which always threaten ſuch, as truſt their Lives to a piece of Wood: For, there will be great Need of thee, if our Intelligence be true in theſe <hi>Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is reported here, That the <hi>Coſſacks, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſians, Mingrelians,</hi> and other <hi>People</hi> who Border on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and Obey not the <hi>Law</hi> brought down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> are entred into a <hi>League</hi> againſt the <hi>Bleſſed Port,</hi> and have covered thoſe Seas with a Mighty Fleet;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102962:33"/>while the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Georgia,</hi> ruſhes down from his Mountains, with an Army of Forty Thouſand <hi>Armenians, Perſians,</hi> and Borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Mount Caucaſus:</hi> That the Former have taken a Thouſand of our Trading <hi>Saicks,</hi> and are advanc'd as far as the <hi>Ferry</hi> of the <hi>Bull,</hi> which thou knoweſt, is but Six Hours Sail from the <hi>Imperial</hi> City: That the Latter, have made Incurſions into the <hi>Territories</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> put all to the Sword who reſiſted 'em, as they march'd along; burnt and laid waſte the Country: And, that all the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> flock to them, threatning an Univerſal Defection from the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Truth of theſe Reports, I can aſcertain Nothing; but am inclin'd to believe, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> are troubleſome at Sea, and that they may have drawn ſome of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours into a <hi>League,</hi> thoſe <hi>Pilfering Nations,</hi> who live by Rapine and Spoil, on <hi>both</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Our ſmall Veſſels trading on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> full of Riches and empty of Arms, muſt needs be a Temptation to thoſe <hi>Pirates,</hi> who are the moſt dextrous at a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, and the boldeſt Fellows in the World. The <hi>Merchants</hi> of theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> who have had ſome Traffick at <hi>Caffa,</hi> and other Towns on the Banks of the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> give a frightful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of thoſe Tempeſtuous Waters, and no Good Character of the <hi>People</hi> that Border on them. The <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> they ſay, are Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and Mercenary; the <hi>Circaſſians</hi> Hardy and Bold; the <hi>Mingrelians</hi> Sly and Crafty;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102962:34"/>and the <hi>Georgians,</hi> of an <hi>Aſtral</hi> Complexion, capable of all Virtues and Vices. The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſeldom act, unleſs encourag'd by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> or the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy;</hi> and then they are content with their Pay, and the Lawful Plunder of War. The <hi>Second</hi> are never Idle, when there is hope of Prey, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they fight their own Cauſe, or are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd by others; and fear neither Hunger, Cold, nor any other Extremity, for the Sake of a Prize. The <hi>Third</hi> are Good at a Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, and would ſteal a Man's Teeth out of his Gums, if he be not wary; Great Cowards, yet deſperate in their own Defence, when they ſee no <hi>Medium</hi> between Fighting and Death. As for the <hi>Fourth,</hi> they ſeem to be a kind of Mungrels, a Medly Race, whoſe Character is compounded of the Other <hi>Three.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are Stout and Witty, Dext'rous at a Cheat, and no Bunglers at an Ingenious Theft; Great Liars; full of Compliments and External Civilities, but Perfidious and Implacable in their Revenges.</p>
                  <p>Yet, after all, I cannot believe the <hi>Prince</hi> of this Country, who is a <hi>Tributary</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> would venture his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at Two ſuch deſperate Stakes, by breaking the <hi>Peace,</hi> concluded by his <hi>Sovereign</hi> with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and ſo drawing upon himſelf the Vengeance of them both. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he is either ſecretly abetted by that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> or elſe the News is falſe.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:102962:34"/>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou know, how this Country came to be Subject to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Perſia?</hi> It was Conquer'd by <hi>Iſmael Sophi,</hi> to whom the <hi>Perſian Hiſtorians,</hi> in Flattery, give the <hi>Epithet</hi> of <hi>Great.</hi> He was the <hi>Firſt</hi> of that <hi>Name,</hi> and of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, that refus'd to obey the <hi>Orthodox Succeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This <hi>Prince,</hi> was Valiant in the Field; and no Coward at Wine, if we may believe one of his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> who wrote <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi> of his <hi>Life.</hi> He Records Sixteen Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, wherein he always got the Victory; and Twice that Number of <hi>Royal</hi> Debauches, when he ſhew'd the Strength of his Brain, in the Company of Foreign <hi>Ambaſſadors;</hi> with whom he would always Carouſe, before they departed his <hi>Court,</hi> that he might ſound the Depth of their Inſtructions; for, none were able to cope with him, at the Juice of the Grape. And he always eſteem'd that Liquor, a Friend to Truth.</p>
                  <p>If he ſuſpected his <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> or any of the <hi>Governors</hi> of <hi>Provinces,</hi> he us'd to invite them to a <hi>Banquet;</hi> where, in the Midſt of his Drinking, he unravell'd their Secret Inclinations and Counſels; being the moſt dextrous at picking the Locks of a Man's Heart, of any one living. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went Alive from his Preſence, if by one falſe Step in their Carriage, though it were but a Word too paſſionate, or a Look leſs compoſed to Reſignation, he could diſcover or frame to himſelf the Grounds of a juſt Jealouſy. It being ever his <hi>Maxim, That
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102962:35"/>Credulity, was the only Vice, could ruin a Happy Prince.</hi> He had another <hi>Saying</hi> alſo, <hi>That</hi> Perſia <hi>was Fertile of Men, but Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Faithful Officers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I cannot admire theſe Cruel Strains of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</hi> Yet <hi>Kings</hi> have Reaſons for their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Words, which we cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. The <hi>Philoſophers</hi> ſay, <hi>That Wine was given <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s by the</hi> Gods, <hi>to mitigate our Cares; and, for a Time, to make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s Equal to their</hi> Divinities, <hi>in the free Enjoyment of Our Selves.</hi> And, tho' as a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> I am not bound to ſubſcribe to the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Pagans;</hi> yet as a Man, Partaker of Fleſh and Blood, I think he doubly miſ-uſes that Liquor, who perverts it to the Ends of Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>But, this <hi>Monarch</hi> had other Thoughts, when by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Georgian</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, having ſubdu'd the <hi>Regions</hi> Bordering on the <hi>Caſpian Sea,</hi> at that Time in the Hands of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> he invited the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Georgia</hi> to his <hi>Tent,</hi> under Pretence of a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival</hi> Joy for their mutual Succeſs. The Unwary <hi>Prince,</hi> truſting to his own Merit, and the Faith of his Neighbour, ventures him ſelf with a Small Guard to the <hi>Camp</hi> of <hi>Iſmael.</hi> The <hi>Perſian</hi> entertain'd him, with all the Outward Demonſtrations of Affection and Gratitude, for his repeated Aids: But, in the End of the <hi>Feaſt,</hi> taking Exceptions at ſome Words the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Georgia</hi> ſpoke, in Praiſe of his own Soldiers, he commanded his <hi>Eunuchs</hi> to ſeize on him, and carry him to the <hi>Tent</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate</hi> (ſo they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102962:35"/>call'd the <hi>Pavilion,</hi> or <hi>Cage</hi> of the <hi>Grandees</hi> fallen into Diſgrace.) Then he gave ſwift Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for the <hi>Georgian</hi> Soldiers to be Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled. And, having thus done, he beſtow'd the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Georgia,</hi> on one <hi>Luarzab;</hi> on Condition, that he and his Succeſſors, would embrace the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Hali,</hi> and pay <hi>Tribute</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this <hi>Luarzab,</hi> has the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Georgia</hi> deſcended, not in a <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Blood,</hi> but at the Pleaſure of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Kings, to him who now holds it, <hi>Shanavas-Can;</hi> Who, I believe, has more Wit, than to hazard his <hi>Poſſeſſions,</hi> for the Sake of a <hi>Chimaera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In thus roving from my firſt Point, thou canſt not blame me, ſince thou thy ſelf act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by the Rules of <hi>Navigation,</hi> which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry according to the Byaſs of the <hi>Needle.</hi> Thou followeſt one <hi>Magnet,</hi> and I another: Yet, let us both meet in the Center of Duty, we owe the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>

And, ſince the <hi>Spahi's</hi> have engag'd ſo many Potent <hi>Baſſa's</hi> in their Quarrels; who can expect to fall, but the Mighty <hi>Favourite</hi> of the <hi>Infantry?</hi>

                  <p>He knows this very well; and, to prevent his own Ruin, he reſolves on Thine and thy Brothers: Thine, under the Maſque of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, till by his Wheadle, he has drawn thy Brother to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where he will not fail to be ſtrangled, that ſo a Creature of the <hi>Vizir,</hi> may be promoted in his Room. And, what will become of thee after this, I leave to thy own Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps, thou wilt deſpiſe the Advice of a Sick Man, and impute my Fears to an Exceſs of <hi>Melancholy;</hi> from which Diſtemper, thou knoweſt, I am ſeldom free. But, I tell thee, my <hi>Reaſon</hi> labours under no <hi>Hypochondriac</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:102962:37"/>Diſorders, though my <hi>Body</hi> may.

But I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe to pray for thy Proſperity, as often as I comply with the <hi>Law,</hi> in Kiſſing the Floor <hi>Five Times</hi> a-Day, and Repeating the appointed <hi>Oraiſons</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks, when I write to thee now, my Pen is at a Loſs. I am puzzl'd for a Style ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy <hi>New</hi> Honour, and our <hi>Old</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>But, if I take too much Liberty, aſcribe it to the Sincerity of my Affection, which knows not how to be reſerv'd or ſtrange to a Perſon, whom once I could call my <hi>Other</hi> ſelf: For, no Wider is the Diſtance between Friends.</p>

                  <p>I Know not, whether what I am going to relate, will be News to thee, or to any of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> Reſiding at the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> However, 'tis ſo to me; and I am command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to conceal nothing of Moment that comes to my Ears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Eldeſt Son of <hi>Achmet,</hi> the <hi>Dey</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> is now at <hi>Rome,</hi> having embraced the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> People relate variouſly, the Motives that induced him to this Change. Some ſay, 'twas Intereſt; he having held a Private Correſpondence with the <hi>Viceroy</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who promiſed him, in the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Name, to make him <hi>Lord</hi> of ſeveral large <hi>Territories</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others ſay, 'twas Diſcontent at his Father's Government, and Auſtere Carriage towards him; the Old Man, having forced him to marry the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Tripoli</hi>'s Daughter againſt his Inclination.</p>
                  <p>But the greateſt Part, aſcribe this Change in <hi>Religion,</hi> to the Force of his <hi>Conſcience;</hi> which, they ſay, was convinced by a <hi>Miracle,</hi> of the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> For, as they relate, being once at Sea in a <hi>Veſſel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were many <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and a Dreadful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ariſing, the Mariners, who were all <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> ſeeing the Havock that the Winds and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102962:38"/>Waves had made of the Ship-Tackle, gave over all for loſt; and fainting under ſo much Labour, Watching and Terrour as they had undergone, lay down, and let the Ship drive where-ever the Storm would carry her. But, there being a <hi>Chriſtian Prieſt</hi> aboard, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed a very Holy and Blameleſs Man, he excited the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> to appeaſe the Wrath of <hi>God</hi> by ſome extraordinary Acts of <hi>Devotion.</hi> Then they all made a ſolemn <hi>Proceſſion</hi> on the Decks of the <hi>Ship,</hi> the <hi>Prieſt</hi> carrying before them, that which they call the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> Imploring the Mercy of <hi>God,</hi> and often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> When behold, as the <hi>Prieſt</hi> ſtood aloft on the <hi>Poop,</hi> reading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud Part of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the Storm ſuddenly ceas'd, the Clouds were diſpers'd, the Air grew Serene and Calm, and the Veſſel got ſafe into Harbour. Upon this, they ſay, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he came aſhore, took that <hi>Prieſt</hi> along with him, deſiring to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the <hi>Chriſtian Belief;</hi> making a Vow alſo, That he would renounce the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> and embrace that of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is what ſuch, as are Zealous for the Honour of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> relate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Princes</hi> Converſion. However it be, it is certain, That he privately made his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from <hi>Tunis</hi> by Sea, and bent his Courſe directly for <hi>Sicily;</hi> where, in a few Days he landed, and was receiv'd by the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of a <hi>Prince.</hi> A while after, he was baptized by an <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:102962:38"/>who gave him the Name of <hi>Don Philippo,</hi> by which he is called in all Places.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, he was a little ſcandalized at firſt, when he ſaw with what Freedom, the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Women appeared abroad in the Streets, and convers'd with Men; but, that afterwards, he took a great Delight in their Company, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that could ſing well, or play on any Inſtrument of Muſick, to which he is much addicted. And therefore, he chuſes to frequent thoſe <hi>Temples,</hi> where their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> is perform'd with Variety of excellent <hi>Muſick,</hi> as it is in all great Cities. And for ought we know, the Character which the <hi>Chriſtian Prieſt</hi> gave him, of this <hi>Harmonious</hi> Manner of <hi>Worſhipping God,</hi> might have no ſmall Influence, on a Man naturally affected with that <hi>Science.</hi> Certainly, Muſick has a mighty Force on our Affections; and, it is a <hi>Proverb</hi> here in the <hi>Weſt, That he who does not love Muſick, has no Soul.</hi> One of the Ancient <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> defined the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf, to be a <hi>Harmony.</hi> And another, was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the various Effects of this <hi>Science,</hi> in raiſing Different Paſſions in Men, that he left it as an <hi>Aphoriſm, Such as the Muſick is, ſuch are the People of a Commonwealth.</hi> Whence, it was the Great Care of ſuch, as took upon them to form the Manners of <hi>Youth,</hi> That no Tunes ſhould be played in their Hearing, which Naturally provoked to Levity and Wantonneſs; but Grave and Martial Strains, ſuch as prompted Heroick Thoughts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them to Vertue. The <hi>Italians,</hi> are
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102962:39"/>great <hi>Maſters</hi> of this <hi>Science;</hi> and the Airs which they compoſe for their <hi>Church-Service,</hi> are very deep and raviſhing. Which cauſes their <hi>New</hi> Proſelyte, <hi>Don Philippo,</hi> to paſs his Time very attentively, during the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of their <hi>High-Maſs,</hi> and their <hi>Even-Song.</hi> They report, that he will turn <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He went from <hi>Sicily,</hi> loaded with Gifts and Preſents, and came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Chriſtians Chief Mufti,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Pope.</hi> He is much honoured and careſſed by the <hi>Holy Father,</hi> and all the <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who have told him ſo many fair Things of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene Faith,</hi> and ſhew'd him ſo many <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Reliques</hi> of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that he thinks himſelf already within the <hi>Verge</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and that <hi>Rome</hi> is no other, than the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> There is ſomething very charming and ſweet, in the Converſation of the <hi>Chriſtian Prelates,</hi> if they be Men of Learning, as moſt generally they are. And, 'tis no wonder that ſuch Polite Company, ſhould prevail much on the flexible Temper of a young <hi>Prince,</hi> who is as a <hi>Pilgrim</hi> in a ſtrange <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> where he can hear Nothing, but perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Eulogies</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> nor ſee any Thing, but Objects, which ſerve only to confirm in his Mind, a Venerable <hi>Idea</hi> of that <hi>Faith</hi> he has embraced. Beſides, they ſay, he is fallen deeply in Love with a young <hi>Roman</hi> Lady. So that there is no Hope, of reſcuing him from the Power of ſo many En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, giving him over as loſt, let us pray the <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> to eſtabliſh <hi>

                  <p>I have ſent a Letter to the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> acquainting him with the News of this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition</hi> of the <hi>Coſſacks.</hi> Since which I am informed, that theſe <hi>People</hi> are Headed by a famous <hi>Pirate</hi> in thoſe <hi>Parts,</hi> a Man of a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Spirit, and capable of the boldeſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.

                  <p>His Name is <hi>Pachicour,</hi> a <hi>Circaſſian</hi> by Birth, but bred up in a <hi>Sea-Town</hi> of the <hi>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krain,</hi> near the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Nieſter.</hi> He left his <hi>Native</hi> Country, at the Age of Twelve Years, out of a Deſire to ſee <hi>Foreign Parts;</hi> Embarking himſelf, unknown to his Parents, in a Veſſel of <hi>Podolia,</hi> which then was ready to ſet ſail from <hi>Bala-Clag.</hi> He carry'd with him a ſmall Sum of Money, which he had purloyn'd from his Father, and ſerv'd as a Fund of his future Fortune: For, arriving at a certain Town in <hi>Podolia,</hi> he frequented the <hi>Keys,</hi> and offer'd his Service to ſeveral <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;</hi> one of which, obſerving in his Face the Marks of a Promiſing <hi>Genius,</hi> entertain'd him in his Houſe. He liv'd with him Seven Years, and perform'd his Office ſo well, that he made him his <hi>Factor</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pachicour</hi> diſcharg'd his Truſt there, with much <hi>Profit</hi> to his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> to <hi>himſelf.</hi> So that at his Return, ſeveral <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> entruſted him with their Goods; and ſent him to trade at <hi>Caffa,</hi> and other Towns on the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> His Judgment and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation encreaſing with his Years, he became in Time famous in all the Trading Towns. And, ſuch was his Credit in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain,</hi> that all the <hi>Merchants</hi> put their Veſſels and Goods into his Hands: So that he ſail'd many Times with a Fleet of Twenty Ships, having the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of all the Goods, committed to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement. He grew ſo Rich in Time by his Dealings, that he was able to drive a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Trade for himſelf. And then it was, he began to lay the Foundation of a Deſign, which he has ſince executed. His <hi>Genius</hi> was too Active, always to be confin'd to this ſlow Way of growing <hi>Great:</hi> Therefore he was reſolv'd at one Blow, to raiſe his Fortune to the Pitch he aim'd at. He was the only <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Banquier</hi> and <hi>Merchant,</hi> where-ever he came.</p>
                  <p>It was no difficult Thing, for a Man of ſo vaſt a Credit, to raiſe an extraordinary Stock; and <hi>Pachicour</hi> could eaſily ſilence the Alarms of <hi>Conſcience.</hi> There happen'd alſo a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, very proper for his Deſign. For, while he was at <hi>Iſgaou,</hi> a <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> Day and Night projecting how to exalt himſelf, a <hi>War</hi> broke out between his <hi>Countrymen</hi> and the <hi>Mingrelians.</hi> The Latter appear'd with a <hi>Navy</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi> which alarm'd all the <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102962:41"/>time Parts</hi> of <hi>Circaſſia. Pachicour</hi> whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention was always buſy, took a Hint from this, to accompliſh his Plot. Expedition was his chiefeſt Game. Therefore he ſpeedily made the utmoſt Uſe of his Credit, among the <hi>Podolian Merchants,</hi> and other <hi>Foreigners</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding at <hi>Iſgaou.</hi> And, when he had amaſs'd together prodigious Sums of Gold, for which he only gave them <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Exchange,</hi> he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately ſends away this huge Treaſure, with all his Jewels, Tiſſues, and other Rich Merchandiſe, to his Fathers Houſe, who liv'd not many Leagues from this Town.</p>
                  <p>Within Two Days after this, the <hi>Mingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Fleet</hi> made a Deſcent at <hi>Iſgaou,</hi> ſack'd it, carry'd away Two Thouſand Captives, and went to their Veſſels again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pachicour,</hi> who knew how to make an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this Opportunity, privately fled after his Wealth, as ſoon as the <hi>Mingrelian Fleet</hi> appear'd before the Place. And it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'ned, that moſt of his Creditors were made Slaves, and tranſported to <hi>Mingrelia.</hi> He had no Need to take any farther Care, but how to ſecure his Riches from his Pilfering Neighbours: For, the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> are all <hi>Profeſs'd Thieves.</hi> He therefore makes haſte to his Father; and having gratified him for his Trouble, he in a ſhort Time purchas'd Four <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> with which he ſets up for a <hi>Pirate,</hi> infeſting thoſe Seas, and Robbing all the <hi>Merchants,</hi> except thoſe who had formerly entruſted him. His Bounty and Valour, charm'd all that ſerv'd him. And,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102962:42"/>his Fame ſpreading with his wonderful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, many <hi>Circaſſians</hi> put out to Sea, and join'd with him: So that in a little Time, he made no ſmall Figure in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Neptune.</hi> Seeing himſelf <hi>Commander</hi> of a <hi>Powerful Navy,</hi> he found out quickly the <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grelian</hi> Fleet, and engaging with them, got a Glorious Victory.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, a <hi>Peace</hi> was concluded, and <hi>Pachicour</hi> was declar'd <hi>Admiral</hi> of all the <hi>Circaſſian</hi> Sea-Forces: To whom the <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grelians</hi> were oblig'd by <hi>Treaty</hi> to join theirs, and to obey <hi>Pachicour</hi>'s Orders. In a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Time, this fortunate <hi>General</hi> became ſo famous, that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſent to him an <hi>Agent,</hi> and enter'd into a <hi>League;</hi> furniſh'd out Three Hundred Veſſels, and join'd the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſian</hi> and <hi>Mingrelian</hi> Fleets.</p>
                  <p>This is the Bottom of the <hi>New Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which makes ſo loud a Noiſe in theſe <hi>Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou who art <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> wilt know what Meaſures are fitteſt to be taken, againſt this bold <hi>Infidel,</hi> if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts to break the <hi>Peace</hi> of the moſt <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Empire.</hi> Yet, though he is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, let us not envy him the Praiſes, that are due to his Wit and Courage.

                     <hi>King,</hi> takes to Heart the untimely Death of his <hi>Father-in-Law,</hi> and cannot be reconciled to his Murderers. Yet, 'tis to be thought, that <hi>Princes</hi> are no farther touch'd with one anothers Misfortunes, than concerns their Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>However, on the 3d. Day of the 5th. <hi>Moon,</hi> ſome <hi>Scots</hi> enter'd into the Lodgings of the <hi>Embaſſador,</hi> and having diſpatch'd him with ſeveral Wounds, made their Eſcape. It is not certainly known, who ſet theſe <hi>Aſſaſſins</hi> at Work. People deſcant variouſly, as their Affections byaſs them.

                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> relate a pretty Paſſage of one of their <hi>Kings,</hi> who before he came to the <hi>Crown,</hi> being <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> had receiv'd very ill Uſage in his Travels from a certain <hi>Italian Lord,</hi> call'd the <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Benevento.</hi> After this Prince was poſſeſs'd of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>

                  <p>I Have often wondred at the <hi>Lethargy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> ſeem to be drown'd. They forget what they read in their own <hi>Bibles:</hi> They there encounter with Expreſſions, which ſavour of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> Every Page of the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law,</hi> reliſhes of the <hi>Dialect</hi> which is Pure and Lively; though the <hi>Tranſlators,</hi> have cropt the Flower of the Sence. I have read their <hi>Bible</hi> in <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> but none of theſe <hi>Languages,</hi> expreſs to the Life the <hi>Original Hebrew:</hi> Nor can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. It is impoſſible to ſcrew up the Dull <hi>Phraſes</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> to the Significant <hi>Idioms</hi> of <hi>Aſia.</hi> We may as well expect <hi>Dates</hi> to ſpring from a <hi>Reed:</hi> And for that Reaſon, it is
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102962:44"/>forbidden the <hi>True faithful,</hi> to Tranſlate the <hi>Volume</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> from the <hi>Original Arabick:</hi> Which is no other, than <hi>Hebrew</hi> in its <hi>Ancient Purity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>Language</hi> of thoſe, who dwell above the <hi>Seventh Orb.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Dialect,</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> converſes with the <hi>Pages</hi> of his <hi>Divine Seraglio:</hi> Wherein all the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Celeſtial Empire</hi> are writ. And when he iſſues out <hi>Orders</hi> to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of <hi>Heaven, Haſmariel</hi> the <hi>Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Immortal Divan,</hi> uſes no other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter or Speech, but that which is peculiar on Earth, to the Sons of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>Region</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of the <hi>Red Sea.</hi> In fine, this is the <hi>Language,</hi> wherein the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> thought fit to diſcover his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to <hi>Mortals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Believe <hi>Mahmut,</hi> when he tells thee with profound Submiſſion, that he has taken ſome Pains to pry into thoſe <hi>Languages,</hi> which have been the Channels of <hi>Divine</hi> Knowledge. I have been peculiarly ambitious, to ſtudy the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Oriental</hi> Words: And it would be no <hi>Hyperbole</hi> to ſay, I have learn'd to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect even the very <hi>Syllables:</hi> Wherein the various placing of Points and Letters, alters the Sence, or at leaſt makes it Ambiguous. So Significant and Myſterious, are Our <hi>Sacred Characters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſpeak not this in Peeviſhneſs, or to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate my ſelf, from the Contempt which <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chingi Cap' Oglani</hi> has put upon me. I have no Emulation in that Point. Nor can any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102962:45"/>little Spur of Pedantick Ambition, make me forward to contend with a Man, whoſe whole Talent conſiſts, in knowing and remembring other Mens <hi>Works;</hi> as if he had ſtudied at <hi>Athens,</hi> only for this End, to learn the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetious Art, of turning his <hi>Brains</hi> into a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue</hi> of <hi>Books:</hi> But I reflect on the <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> among the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> who are chiefly to blame, having the Cuſtody of the <hi>Book</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to 'em from the <hi>Jews.</hi> And among them, the <hi>Tranſlators</hi> of that <hi>Volume,</hi> are paſt Excuſe; for, they have deflowr'd the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and robb'd the <hi>Virgin Language,</hi> of its Beauty and Honour: While the Reſt are Witneſſes, and ſilent Abettors of the Rape, in concealing the Indignity has been done to the <hi>Letters</hi> Form'd by the <hi>Finger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and full of <hi>Divine Myſteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In thus accuſing the <hi>Chriſtian Interpreters</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> I do not patronize the <hi>Critical</hi> Whimſies of the <hi>Jewiſh Caballiſts.</hi> They are exploded by all Men of Sence. Yet there is a <hi>Medium,</hi> between the Exceſs of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Niceneſs, which has rendred the <hi>One</hi> Ridiculous, and of that ſtudy'd Careleſsneſs, to which the Obſcurity of the <hi>Other</hi> is owing. As the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> by preſſing the Letters too cloſe, have ſqueez'd out <hi>Divine Chimaera's;</hi> ſo the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in uſing too ſlack a Hand, have ſcarce gain'd a groſs Draught of Common Human Sence, leaving the Genuine <hi>Elixir</hi> of the Writer's Meaning behind.</p>
                  <p>I will not lay much to the Charge of the <hi>Tranſlators,</hi> employ'd by <hi>Ptolomy Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:102962:45"/>King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Theſe were no <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> nor yet in the Number of thoſe, who <hi>Adored</hi> the <hi>Celeſtial Bodies</hi> and <hi>Elements:</hi> Nor did any of them, pay their <hi>Devotions</hi> at the ſame <hi>Altar</hi> with that <hi>Aegyptian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,</hi> who was a <hi>Worſhipper</hi> of the <hi>God Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis:</hi> But they were <hi>Jews,</hi> Seventy, or Two more in Number, as the <hi>Tradition</hi> goes. And, being every one Commanded <hi>ſeverally</hi> to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate</hi> thoſe <hi>Manuſcripts,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> without conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with, or ſeeing each other; 'tis ſaid, their <hi>Verſions</hi> all agree'd to a <hi>Syllable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Story of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſeems to be Credited by the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Yet ſome have found many Errors and Incongruities, in that <hi>Celebrated Copy.</hi> And, 'tis eaſy for an Impartial Eye, eſpecially in the Head of an <hi>Oriental,</hi> to ſpy many more.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Latin,</hi> which they call the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation,</hi> is full of Miſtakes. And the Pretended <hi>Saint</hi> who made it, ſhould have gone farther than <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> for his Intelligence in <hi>Ancient Hebrew.</hi> His Name (if I miſtake not) was <hi>Hieronymus.</hi> He paſs'd many Years, in a <hi>Cell</hi> near the ſuppos'd <hi>Tomb</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Meſſiah,</hi> in the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> Where, they ſay, he was <hi>Inſpir'd</hi> with the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and from thence, ventur'd upon a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not expect a Certificate of theſe Things from <hi>Mahmut,</hi> who only tells thee what he has read in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Authors, whom they call the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of their <hi>Church.</hi>

                  <p>But, I can aſſure thee, 'twas no <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> aſſiſted this <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> in his <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> For, he comes far ſhort of rightly rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Lofty <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> Appoſite <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> Elegant <hi>Figures,</hi> and other <hi>Ornaments</hi> of <hi>Speech,</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Writings</hi> of thoſe, who firſt ſee the <hi>Riſing Sun.</hi> Such are all thoſe, penn'd in the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> From which we muſt not exclude the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Reſt of the <hi>Hebrew Prophets, Poets, Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> Of theſe does the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> conſiſt; except one <hi>Book,</hi> writ by my Coutryman <hi>Jub,</hi> who Five Times foil'd the <hi>Devil,</hi> in ſo many <hi>ſet Combats</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay then, of the <hi>Tranſlations</hi> that have been made of their <hi>Bible</hi> in other <hi>Languages,</hi> not ſo Copious and Significant as the <hi>Latin?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since the Diviſion aroſe, between the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> their <hi>Bible</hi> has been taught to ſpeak the <hi>Dialect</hi> of all or moſt <hi>Nations</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> Yet, ſuch is the Unhappineſs of the <hi>Franks,</hi> that the more they tamper with the <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Great Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> the worſe they ſucceed.

                  </p>
                  <p>What Room will they leave for the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> if the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> themſelves are thus Critical, upon the <hi>Grand Patent</hi> of their <hi>Salvation?</hi>

                  <p>It would be an endleſs Task, to recount

                  </p>
                  <p>Permit me to glance only on the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> or the <hi>Odes</hi> of <hi>Sultan David.</hi> How flat and dull are the <hi>Meaſures</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?</hi> How low have they ſunk the Sence of that <hi>Royal Poet?</hi> He never begun to warble forth any of thoſe <hi>Divine Songs,</hi> till firſt Inſpired by a <hi>Seraph,</hi> whom he had lur'd down from <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> by the Melody of his <hi>Harp.</hi> That <hi>Seraph,</hi> was <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Muſick</hi> Above, as the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> teach. Every Time <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> play'd on his <hi>Inſtrument, Ariel</hi> (for ſo was the <hi>Spirit</hi> call'd) made his Deſcent, and ſung with a Grace which cannot be expreſs'd. The Docile <hi>Poet,</hi> ſoon learn'd both his Notes and Words. Seven Hundred Times, <hi>David</hi> touch'd his Harmonious Strings, and ſo often the <hi>Angel</hi> ſtood by him with the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Quire.</hi> He taught him Seven Hundred <hi>Sonnets,</hi> that are Chanted by the <hi>Lovers</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> But the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtole 'em from the <hi>King,</hi> whilſt he was gazing on another Man's Wife, bathing her ſelf in an adjoining Garden.</p>
                  <p>Yet there are above a Hundred <hi>Hymns</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, which <hi>David</hi> compos'd by Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of the Former.

                  </p>
                  <p>So have they dealt by that ſurpaſſing <hi>Poem</hi> of <hi>Solyman,</hi> taught him by the <hi>Etherial Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102962:47"/>of his <hi>Father.</hi> For <hi>Ariel</hi> was enamour'd of One of the <hi>Virgins</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> at the ſame Time, that <hi>Solyman</hi> enjoy'd <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and had newly built for her a <hi>Seraglio</hi> of <hi>Cedar.</hi> The <hi>Heavenly Lover</hi> therefore, to accommodate himſelf to the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of the <hi>Mortal,</hi> taught him One of the <hi>Paſtorals</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> a <hi>Song</hi> peculiar to his Own <hi>Amour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> have turn'd it to a dry and Inſignificant <hi>Allegory,</hi> by their <hi>Gloſſes:</hi> Putting an Affront alſo upon <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Poetry,</hi> in Wording their <hi>Tranſlation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I ſhould go on, and number the Miſtakes they have made in the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and other <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> though it were but in this <hi>General</hi> Manner, I ſhould tire thee out: But to recount the <hi>Particulars,</hi> would be a <hi>Thirteenth Task</hi> for <hi>Hercules.</hi>

                  <p>During this <hi>Conſult,</hi> the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Army, are permitted by the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Agreement, to Quarter up and down in <hi>Seven Circles</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and not to be diſcharg'd, till all their Arrears are paid at the Coſt of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, it will amount to Three Millions of <hi>Sequins.</hi> This <hi>War</hi> has laſted near Thirty Years; in which, above Three Hundred Thouſand Men have loſt their Lives.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs, the Prevailing Party there, have declar'd that <hi>Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to be a <hi>Free State,</hi> and the <hi>Monarchy</hi> is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102962:48"/>Aboliſh'd by a <hi>Publick Act.</hi> Nevertheleſs, after <hi>Charles</hi> was beheaded, his Eldeſt Son was Proclaimed <hi>King,</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by ſome of the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> that were Friends to that <hi>Royal Family.</hi> And in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a certain great <hi>Duke</hi> appear'd at the Head of a Numerous Army, in Behalf of the Young <hi>King</hi>'s Intereſt, having laid Siege to the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom;</hi> which, with one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Town, were the only ſtrong Holds, that reſiſted the <hi>King</hi>'s Party.

This being ſeconded with other Victories, in a ſhort Time, reduc'd that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> under the Obedience of the <hi>Engliſh States.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, I hear no pleaſing News from the <hi>Levant.</hi> Veſſels daily arrive in the <hi>Havens</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who confirm each other's Relations, of a Dreadful <hi>Naval</hi> Combat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Our <hi>Fleet</hi> and that of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> wherein they ſay, we have loſt Seventy Two <hi>Gallies,</hi> Threeſcore <hi>Merchant</hi>-Veſſels, and Eighteen <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War:</hi> That in this Fight, Six Thouſand Five Hundred <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> have loſt their Lives, and near Ten Thouſand were taken Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, theſe are great Breaches in the <hi>Navy,</hi> which, belonging to the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> has aſſum'd to it ſelf the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet

'Tis not in my Praiſe I ſpeak it; for, I believe this Tenderneſs, to be rather a <hi>Vice</hi> of my <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> than to have any Rank in the <hi>Morals,</hi> much leſs to be of Kin to the <hi>Family</hi> of <hi>Vertues.</hi> I pity a Man falling into Diſgrace, on whom the <hi>Weather</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> changes, from which he muſt expect Nothing but Clouds and Storms.

                  <p>VVE have had a violent hot <hi>Summer</hi> in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> with much <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning;</hi> which has done conſiderable Damage to the <hi>Farmers,</hi> in burning their Hay and Corn in their <hi>Granaries.</hi> Complaints arrive here daily from all the <hi>Provinces,</hi> That <hi>Heaven</hi> has conſum'd their <hi>Harveſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This the <hi>Court</hi>-Party interpret, as a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on them for their <hi>Rebellions;</hi> cauſing it to be iuduſtriouſly ſpread about in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, That <hi>Heaven</hi> is Angry with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants</hi> of <hi>Guyenne, Bourdeaux,</hi> and other <hi>Provinces,</hi> for taking up Arms this Year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> I know not how far this Cenſure is Juſtifiable: But, 'tis obſerv'd, That the People of theſe <hi>Rebellious Provinces,</hi> have received more Apparent and Irreparable Injuries by the <hi>Lightning,</hi> than thoſe of other <hi>Parts.</hi> Several <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Aix,</hi> were found dead in their Beds, after a Tempeſtuous Night of <hi>Lightning.</hi> And, next Day, the <hi>Roof</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> where they <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> fell down and kill'd ſeveral.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Great Church</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> as they were Celebrating their <hi>Maſs,</hi> a Ball of Fire broke in from behind the <hi>Altar,</hi> ſmote down
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102962:51"/>ſeveral <hi>Images,</hi> and filling the <hi>Church</hi> with an Intolerable Stink, flew out at a Window, without doing any farther Harm. And a great Bank of Money, rais'd by this City to pay their Soldiers, was all melted down by <hi>Lightning,</hi> to the Aſtoniſhment of thoſe who ſaw it; for, it was done in the Day-Time, the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> being preſent. It would be endleſs, to recount all the Miſchiefs that have been done in thoſe <hi>Parts.</hi> We had no great Harm here, ſave that almoſt all the <hi>Wine</hi> in the City, was turn'd to a Kind of <hi>Vinegar</hi> in one Night. Which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> attribute to the Peculiar <hi>Energy</hi> of <hi>Lightning;</hi> which plays the <hi>Chymiſt</hi> with this Liquor, and in a Moment ſeparates and drinks up its Vital Spirits, leaving only a <hi>Mortuum Caput</hi> behind.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seaſon</hi> has been ſo hot during the <hi>Dog-Days,</hi> that the Air it ſelf ſeem'd Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the very Winds, from whence we look'd for Refreſhment, were like the Breath of a Stove: All Things ſeem'd ready to take Fire, as if the <hi>Elements</hi> waited for the <hi>Grand Conflagration.</hi> Heat was the Cry every where. Men's Bodies were ſcalded with Internal Flames; the Shade of Trees afforded no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; the Fountains could not allay their Thirſt. All <hi>Nature</hi> ſeem'd to be in a <hi>Fever,</hi> ready to expire.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe Fervors are abated, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to have Froſty Mornings. The Nitrous Air, reſtores Mens Appetites; Abundance of Rain, has new-moulded the gaping parch'd
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102962:52"/>Earth, and produc'd a <hi>Second Spring.</hi> The Husbandman comforts himſelf with the Hopes of <hi>Another</hi> Crop of Hay, to repair the Loſs of the <hi>Former,</hi> which the <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> robb'd him of. In the mean Time, the Winds are very buſy, in diſrobing the Trees, and ſcattering not only their Leaves, but alſo the Fruit that is not gather'd, on the Ground; whereby a <hi>Banquet</hi> is prepar'd for the <hi>Hogs</hi> in every <hi>Orchard,</hi> who claim as much Right to feed on what lies on the <hi>Common Table,</hi> as their <hi>Owners.</hi> And 'tis no Unpleaſant <hi>Muſick,</hi> to hear a Herd of <hi>Swine,</hi> ſet their Teeth at Work on the Wind-fallen Apples.

He beholds with Admiration and Pleaſure, the Gilded Clouds and Tops of Mountains, when the <hi>Sun</hi> comes forth of his <hi>Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> He ſpurs himſelf on to his daily Labour, by the Example of that Active <hi>Planet,</hi> following his Work with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Joy.

                  <p>Tell me, Dear <hi>Hali,</hi> are not theſe proper Objects of Envy, to a Man in my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?

And yet, all this while they will perſwade me, I am a Good Man, and ſhall go to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> As if the <hi>Mufti's</hi> Diſpenſation, were available to cancel the Expreſs, Poſitive <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God!</hi> Do they think to amuſe me with ſuch Umbrages, and ſend me muzzl'd to <hi>Hell</hi> with my Eyes open? I tell thee, I have a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as will not let me be at Reſt in this Manner of Life. It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to die, than to live ſtain'd with ſo many Prevarications. I know not what to do, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſo many Terrors: I feel my Body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay apace, and haſtening towards its Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; What will become of me, if I ſhould die under the Burthen of ſo many Sins? What Anſwer ſhall I be able to make, to the <hi>Two Inquiſitors</hi> of the <hi>Grave,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> who ſhall Examine me, Who is my <hi>God?</hi> and, Who is my <hi>Prophet?</hi> and, What is my <hi>Faith?</hi> The Darkneſs of that <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> will not be ſufficient to hide my Bluſhes, and the Confuſion I ſhall be in at ſo preſſing a Tryal.</p>
                  <p>All my Comfort is, that I have yet Friends left, to whom I may freely vent my Thoughts, and ask their Counſel.</p>

                  <p>If thou haſt any Remains of that Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that has been between us, weigh my Caſe throughly, and tell me, Whether I am not loſt for Ever, without a Change of Life? Flatter me not, neither uſe the Artifices of Civility, in palliating my Crimes. But, ſearch my Wounds, and give me thy Advice without a Veil; and <hi>Mahmut</hi> ſhall eſteem thee, the <hi>Phyſician</hi> of his <hi>Soul.</hi>

                  <p>IF I have not addreſſed to thee before, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to my Ignorance of thy <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Perſon.</hi> As ſoon as I heard of thy Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this <hi>Important Truſt,</hi> I reſolv'd to ſalute thee, as becomes a <hi>Slave</hi> in my Poſt, and to wiſh thee all the Happineſs thou canſt deſire. Yet, when I congratulate thy <hi>Riſe,</hi> remember, I do but welcome thee to a <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice,</hi> a meer <hi>Pinnacle</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> where thou haſt no Reaſon to expect ſecure Footing. The Blaſt of an Envious Mouth, will make thee totter. Thou breatheſt in an <hi>Element,</hi> full of Tempeſts. The ſly Practices of a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:102962:54"/>may undermine thee; or, the more open Frowns of thy <hi>Sovereign,</hi> may caſt thee down. Thou art ever liable to the Malice of the Vulgar, and not a little in Danger of thy own Weakneſs, the Inſeparable Companion of Humanity. If thou ſhouldeſt once look with Diſdain on thoſe that are beneath thee, the vaſt Diſtance and Height of the Proſpect, may make thee Giddy. Therefore, it will be good for thee, to have thy Eyes always fixt on thy ſelf. That will prove the beſt <hi>Chart,</hi> by which to ſteer thy Courſe, through the Rocks and Sands, which on all Hands threaten the Life of a <hi>Courtier.</hi> It will not be amiſs alſo, to place before thee, the Examples of Wiſe Men, thy <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> There is a greater Force in theſe, than in the beſt Counſels; becauſe, Matter of Fact, leaves no Room for Diſtruſt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Men are Naturally jealous of thoſe who pretend to inſtruct them. We are all fond of our own Reaſon and Judgment; and are apt to ſuſpect him of ſome Deſign, who ſeeks to perſwade us, though to our Good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is a <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Pride,</hi> a <hi>Punctilio</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> in <hi>Mortals,</hi> which will hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us to yield our ſelves in a Condition, to need anothers Advice: Whence comes the <hi>Arabian Proverb,</hi> which ſays, <hi>A Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits more by the Sight of an Idiot, than by the Orations of the Learned.</hi> We all love to make our own Experiments, and ſooner truſt any Sence than our Ears. Therefore, the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> cauſed their <hi>Slaves</hi> to be made drunk in the Preſence of their Children; that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102962:54"/>from the <hi>Squalidneſs</hi> of the <hi>Spectacle,</hi> they might conceive a Hatred againſt that Vice, which by all the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> in the World, they would never learn to abhor.</p>
                  <p>The Crimes of ſome in thy <hi>Station,</hi> have more of Sobriety in them, but leſs Honeſty. Wonder not at the Expreſſion, nor accuſe me of Impudence. I reflect only on the <hi>Wicked:</hi> Number not thy ſelf among them.</p>
                  <p>Thou knoweſt, it has been an Ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom for our Renowned <hi>Emperors,</hi> to divert themſelves at certain Times, with the Sight of their <hi>Ineſtimable Treaſury.</hi> I am no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Ceremonies uſed at ſuch Times. One would think it impoſſible, amidſt ſo much Caution, that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſhould be defrauded of the leaſt Part of his Wealth. I do not ſpeak of the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> or thoſe others which make up the <hi>Imperial Wardrobe.</hi> The Bulk and Weight of thoſe Rich Velvet <hi>Broccades,</hi> and other Furniture of Gold and Silver, diſcourages the Theft. But who can number the <hi>Robberies</hi> that have been committed among the <hi>Jewels,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable Rareties</hi> of the <hi>Myſterious Cloſet?</hi> It has been found eaſy to conceal and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport from thence, whole Beds of Diamonds and Chains of Pearl, undiſcovered, I will not ſay unſuſpected, at the Times when <hi>Anak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar-Agaſi</hi> gives <hi>Three Knocks,</hi> on the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of the <hi>Keys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are Hours of Munificence and Royal Bounty, when the <hi>Auguſt Lord</hi> of the <hi>Mines,</hi> is pleas'd to gratifie his <hi>Slaves</hi> with Gifts, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102962:55"/>make them ſenſible they ſerve <hi>Him,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands this <hi>

                  <p>No <hi>Prince</hi> can diſcommend this Domeſtick Sport of our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> when he makes his <hi>Pages</hi> ſcramble for <hi>Diamonds</hi> and <hi>Rubies;</hi> ſince it gives him a Taſte of his own <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> Nothing being more agreeable, in Caſes on this Side of Amorous Jealouſy, than to let others partake of our Pleaſures. And, 'tis the peculiar Delight of <hi>Kings,</hi> ſometimes to lay aſide their State and Grandeur, to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with their Attendants; making them their Companions, or at leaſt, their <hi>Proxies</hi> in many Enjoyments.</p>
                  <p>But, 'tis Pity this Favour ſhould be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as it has been in the Inſtance I mention'd. Thou art no Stranger to the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Haſna,</hi> which tell us, That when <hi>Gelep Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus-Baſſa,</hi> was made <hi>Chief Treaſurer</hi> in the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Sultan Muſtapha,</hi> the Lucre of the Glittering Jewels had tempted him to defraud his <hi>Maſter,</hi> to the Value of Five Hundred Thouſand <hi>Sequins.</hi> Which, upon the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Three <hi>Pages,</hi> and a diligent Search, were found in his Trunks.</p>
                  <p>It has been whiſper'd alſo, That few have enjoyed that Office, who have not purloyn'd Something from the <hi>Imperial</hi> Coffers. They ſay, 'tis an Hereditary Theft, deliver'd by Tradition from one to another. Every <hi>Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadarbaſſi</hi> being advanc'd to that Honour, by the Recommendation of his <hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> for the Service he has done him in conniving
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102962:55"/>at theſe Practices, which cannot be hid from any of the <hi>Sixty</hi> who Guard the <hi>Royal Wealth.</hi>

                  <p>Thou canſt not blame me, for putting thee in Mind of theſe Things; in Regard I am commanded, to write with all Freedom to the <hi>Sublime Miniſters,</hi> whatever concerns the Intereſt of Our <hi>Great Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have no more to ſay, but to deſire thee, in tranſmitting what Money is appointed for me, to be Timely and Punctual; to ſend <hi>Duplicates</hi> by different <hi>Poſts,</hi> that if one ſhould miſcarry, I may not be at a Loſs: For, there is no Credit for a <hi>Muſſulman</hi> in <hi>Paris.

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Peſtelihali, <hi>his Brother.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>I Unwillingly Concluded my laſt Letter, before I had vented Half my Thoughts on thoſe <hi>Oriental</hi> Subjects, ſo full of Inſtruction and Pleaſure. Thy <hi>Journal</hi> is become my Pocket-Companion. I carry it with me to the <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Solitudes,</hi> and even to the <hi>Libraries,</hi> and <hi>Churches:</hi> To which Laſt, I am obliged to go ſometimes, That I may avoid Suſpicion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when they enter the moſt Delightful <hi>Gardens</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſpend their Time, and weary themſelves, in walking forward and backward. They will meaſure Several Leagues, in traverſing one <hi>Alley:</hi> Which vain Cuſtom, thou knoweſt, is contrary to the Practice of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> People, who love to ſolace themſelves, in ſitting ſtill under the cool Shades, and feeding their Eyes with the Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Verdure of Trees, their Noſes with the frequent Smell of Herbs and Flowers, and their Ears with the pretty Melody of the Birds: All which, ſerve as Helps to their Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                  <p>After this Manner, I many Times paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome Hours in the <hi>Gardens</hi> of this City, whereof there are great Plenty. And, when I am cloy'd with the forementioned Pleaſures, then I take out thy <hi>Journal,</hi> and fall to Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102962:56"/>which winds up my Thoughts afreſh' like a Watch that is down: Nay, it opens new Sources of Contemplation, and ſerves as a Miraculous <hi>Taliſman,</hi> to bring <hi>China, India,</hi> and all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> into the Place where I am; ſo Lively and Natural, are thy Diſcourſes of thoſe <hi>Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I am in the <hi>Churches,</hi> it ſerves me inſtead of a <hi>Prayer-Book:</hi> And, whilſt Others are babbling over they know not what, or, at leaſt, they care not what; I offer up to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Firſt Fruit</hi> of my Reaſon and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which he has given me to diſtinguiſh me from all Sorts of Beaſts; whether in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Shape, or not.</p>
                  <p>When I go to the <hi>Libraries,</hi> I compare thy <hi>Journal</hi> with the <hi>Writings</hi> of Others who treat of the ſame Matters; and find, that thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeſt with ſome, correcteſt the Miſtakes of others, and in all, ſheweſt a <hi>Genius</hi> elevated above all others of the Common <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Travellers,</hi> who ſeek rather to amuſe the Reader with uncouth Stories and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, than to Inſtruct him with what is really Uſeful and Profitable.</p>
                  <p>Thus thy <hi>Journal,</hi> is become the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my Solitudes, the Object of my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the Help to my Devotions Abroad; and, it is no leſs, the Diverſion of my Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Melancholy at Home. I am a great Admirer of <hi>Antiquity:</hi> And therefore an old Craggy Rock, o'er-grown with Moſs, and full of gaping <hi>Chaſms,</hi> is a more agreeable Sight to me, than the Flow'ry Meadows or
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:102962:57"/>Verdant Groves; becauſe the <hi>Former,</hi> looks like a <hi>Relique</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Chaos;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, I know the <hi>Latter,</hi> to be only the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Laſt <hi>Spring.</hi> 'Tis for this Reaſon, thy <hi>Narrative</hi> affords me ſo vaſt a Delight, becauſe it treats of the moſt Ancient <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> and <hi>Governments</hi> in the <hi>World:</hi> And is not ſtuffed, with <hi>Chimaera's</hi> and <hi>Fables,</hi> as moſt <hi>Relations</hi> of thoſe Countries are; but, gives a ſincere and true Account of whatever is Conſiderable, without touching on Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies.</p>
                  <p>But, above all, I am delighted with that Part, which relates thy <hi>Travels</hi> in <hi>China:</hi> That Country, being of ſo vaſt an Extent, ſo Rich, ſo Populous; the People ſo Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, Learned and Politick (beſides the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of their <hi>Empire,</hi> which cannot in that Point be matched by any <hi>Government</hi> under the <hi>Heavens;</hi>) that the exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe Things, ſeems to me of greater Moment, than any other Diſcoveries what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p>What thou ſayeſt of the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Letters and Words, ſhews, that thou haſt made ſome Inſpection into that <hi>Language.</hi> And, thy Remarks on the long <hi>Succeſſion</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of their <hi>Kings,</hi> is an Argument, That thou art no Stranger to their <hi>Chronology,</hi> which takes in many Thouſands of Years before <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s <hi>Flood.</hi> Thou art very exact in enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating their Publick <hi>Tribunals</hi> and <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Juſtice;</hi> as alſo, in deſcribing ſome Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Bridges, Temples, Palaces, and other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102962:57"/>Structures: Which ſerves to give the Reader a true <hi>Idea,</hi> of the Magnificence and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the <hi>Chineſe Emperors;</hi> and of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of the <hi>People,</hi> who ſeem to excel all others in <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences.</hi> In a Word, it is evident, That thou didſt not paſs thy Time with thy Arms folded, whilſt thou wert in that <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And; I know not how bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to expreſs the Eſteem I have for thee, on the Account of the Pains thou haſt taken, to Inform both thy ſelf and me in Matters of ſo great Importance, than by giving thee an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what Progreſs the <hi>Tartars</hi> have made in the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> of that <hi>Empire,</hi> ſince thy Return to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> In my Laſt, I acquainted thee, with the <hi>Coronation</hi> of the <hi>Tartar</hi>-King at <hi>Pekin.</hi> Since which, Other Veſſels are arrived from thoſe <hi>Parts,</hi> which bring an Account, that the Young <hi>Tartarian Conquerour,</hi> ſoon puſhed forward his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And marching with an Army into <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> (which <hi>Kingdom,</hi> thou knoweſt, borders on <hi>China</hi>) the King of that <hi>Country,</hi> made his Submiſſions; and entering into a League with <hi>Zunchi,</hi> held his <hi>Crown</hi> in <hi>Fee</hi> of that Victorious <hi>Emperour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards, he haſtened to ſubdue the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> which remained Unconquered. His Method in accompliſhing this Great Work, was by ſwift Marches, like another <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> and by laying Siege to the Principal City of a <hi>Province,</hi> which he never failed, either to take by Force, or compelled to ſurrender, that ſo they might eſcape Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102962:58"/>And when this was done, he took Poſſeſſion, both of it and the whole <hi>Province,</hi> ſummoning the Cities of Leſſer Note to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; which they ſeldom refuſed, after they had beheld the <hi>Fate</hi> of the Firſt. Thus in a little Time, he became <hi>Maſter</hi> of all that ſpacious <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fame of his Succeſs, quickly brought Innumerable <hi>Tartars</hi> out of their <hi>Native Country,</hi> to follow the Fortune of their <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> To theſe he gave the <hi>Chief Offices</hi> of his <hi>Army,</hi> and continued the <hi>Chineſes</hi> in the Adminiſtration of <hi>Civil</hi> Affairs. And, as a Token of their Subjection, he commanded all the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> to cut their Hair ſhort, and to Cloath themſelves after the Faſhion of the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They give a High Character of this Young <hi>Prince,</hi> who amidſt ſo many Succeſſes and Triumphs, diſcovers not the leaſt vain Glory, but contains himſelf within the Bounds of a vertuous Moderation, aſcribes all to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and, is not in the leaſt puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up, with any of his Glorious Actions; which is an Argument, of a Spirit truly He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick. And yet, this <hi>Prince</hi> is an <hi>Idolater,</hi> as are all the <hi>Tartars</hi> of that Nation; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are Men of no <hi>Religion,</hi> which makes their <hi>Morals</hi> the more admirable. For, according to the Relation of thoſe who came laſt from <hi>China,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> are a very Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and Continent People, abhorring thoſe Vices, which are but too common in other Parts of the World, and from which the <hi>True
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102962:58"/>Believers</hi> them ſelves are not Free. They are Rigorouſly Juſt alſo, and puniſh all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Fraud and Deceit, with Immediate Death. As for their Conduct and Courage in the Wars, there is no <hi>Nation</hi> ſurpaſſes them, Few are their equals. They are Paſſionate Lovers of an Active Life, ſpending moſt of their Time on Horſe-back, either in Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wild Beaſts, or fighting with their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And their Horſes are the beſt and moſt Courageous in the World. There is Nothing the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſo much deſpiſe, as the Sedentary Life of <hi>Students</hi> and Learned Men; accounting them, the Burden of a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> Lazy Drones, fit only to be ſold for Slaves. But Men of Service and Merit in the Wars, they have in great Eſteem; never failing, to reward ſuch with Dignities and Commands, proportionable to their Deſerts and Capacities. Nay, ſuch is the Martial <hi>Genius</hi> of this Nation, That the very Women Ride to the Wars with the Men, and perform Exploits above what is expected from that ſoft and delicate Sex. Both Men and Women, are habituated from their Infancy, to live in Tents or Waggons, there being very few Cities in all <hi>Tartary.</hi> There they are inur'd to Hunger, Cold, Thirſt, and all the Methods of a Frugal and Hardy Life. This is that, which renders them Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Souldiers, and a Terrour to all the Nations round about them. This is that, which ſo ſoon Reduced all <hi>China</hi> to their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; the <hi>Chineſes,</hi> among all their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Accompliſhments, being the moſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102962:59"/>Effeminate People on Earth. This, no doubt, thou haſt obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Brother, I adviſe thee, to go to <hi>Kerker Haſſan, Baſſa,</hi> our Countryman, and preſent to him theſe Obſervations on the <hi>Tartars;</hi> which thou mayſt eaſily do, by tranſcribing what is for thy turn, out of this Letter. He Inherits his Fathers <hi>Genius;</hi> who, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, was one of the Greateſt <hi>Hunters</hi> in all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi> and had a Character, not much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what I have here given thee of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> That <hi>Baſſa,</hi> will take great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in theſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> and will think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged, to make thee ſome proper Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment. He is Generous and Great, and it lies in his Power to promote thee. I have writ to him already, and have given him an <hi>Encomium</hi> of thy Ability.

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Kerker Haſſan, Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>I Received thy Commands, and am proud of the Honour thou haſt done me, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the ſmalleſt Service at my Hands; eſpecially, one of this Nature: Which is an Argument, that my Former Relation of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> was acceptable to thee. This I account my Honour and Happineſs, that I have a Brother, who has made ſuch conſiderable Improvements in his <hi>Travels:</hi> For, 'tis to him, I owe the Knowledge I have of that Country, and the other <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt.</hi> As for my Couſin <hi>Iſouf,</hi> he would never vouchſafe to ſend me a Syllable, relating to his <hi>Travels,</hi> though he had rambled through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I deſired this Favour of him in ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but have receiv'd no Anſwer; ſo that I know not, whether he be Dead or Alive. My Friends are very backward in writing to me: And, unleſs it be ſome of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> who ſometimes honour me with a <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> though very rarely, I hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Letter from my familiar Friends and Relations in Twenty <hi>Moons.</hi> Which makes me conclude, that Abſence of ſo long a Date, has quite blotted me out of their Minds.</p>
                  <p>As to what thou deſireſt farther to know concerning <hi>China,</hi> my Brother ſays, That
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102962:60"/>
                     <hi>Empire</hi> contains 4400 wall'd Towns and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; 3000 Caſtles and Towers of Defence on the Frontiers, wherein are always Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned a Million of Souldiers, who are relieved at due Times, by others of equal Number. There are a Million alſo conſtantly kept in Pay, to guard the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces, Embaſſadors,</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> maintaining Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand Horſe, to attend his Perſon. All this is, in Time of <hi>Peace.</hi> But, upon any <hi>Revolt</hi> or <hi>Invaſion,</hi> the Forces are Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. There are in <hi>China</hi> 331 Bridges, Remarkable for their Strength and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, beyond all others in the World. 2099 Mountains; Lakes and Medicinal Fountains 1472; 1159 Triumphal Arches and other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, erected in Honour of Valiant: and Learned Men; 272 Libraries, abounding with all Manner of Excellent Books. <hi>Temples</hi> 300000, and as many <hi>Prieſts,</hi> beſides the <hi>Convents</hi> of their <hi>Religious.</hi> They reverence 3036 Male-<hi>Saints,</hi> and 208 Female. All which have <hi>Temples</hi> dedicated to their Honour, beſides thoſe which are conſecrated to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Fire, Air, Earth and Water, and to the <hi>Heavens</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend All, and to the <hi>Celeſtial Gods</hi> who rule All, and to the <hi>Supreme God,</hi> Creator of the <hi>Worlds.</hi> In theſe <hi>Temples,</hi> they celebrate the Praiſes of their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Heroes,</hi> with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and Songs, Incenſe and Sacrifices; belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that all Things which are conſpicuous for the Excellency of their Nature, or from
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102962:60"/>which Mankind receives any General or Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Benefit, ought to be worſhipped with <hi>Divine</hi> Honours. In this, they differ not from the Ancient <hi>Pagans</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> who had almoſt as Many <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes,</hi> as there were ſeveral Creatures in the World; ſo that there was no Beginning nor Ending of their Superſtitions: And, the moſt Learned, and Contemplative of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> found the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of their <hi>Religion,</hi> to be an Inextricable Labyrinth, where they were often loſt. Certainly, happy are the <hi>Faithful Muſſulmans,</hi> who <hi>Adore</hi> but <hi>One God,</hi> the <hi>Fountain</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> without entangling themſelves, in the Abſurdities of <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chineſes,</hi> are great Admirers of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Own <hi>Nation;</hi> believing, that no People can ſtand in Competition with them, for Learning, Wiſdom and Riches. They have a very contemptible <hi>Idea</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Countries,</hi> with their Inhabitants; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming them, either as <hi>Ideots,</hi> or <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Conceitedneſs, is owing to their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Reſt of the World; for, they ſeldom or never, travel beyond the Limits of their own <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could ſay a great Deal more of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but, it will be better for thee, to hear it from my Brother, who has been there, and can give thee ample Satisfaction in all Things, relating to that <hi>Empire.</hi> I have wrote to him, to go and kiſs the Duſt before thy Feet. If thou makeſt Tryal of his Abilities, thou
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102962:61"/>wilt find him improved by his Travels, a Man ſit for Buſineſs, and one in whom thou mayſt confide; Which is a Vertue, never enough to be prized in theſe corrupt Times.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Things however, mingle thy own Diſcretion, with the Kindneſs of a Country-Man, and the Affection of a Friend.</p>

                  <p>But the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Known Hiſtory,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates but Two <hi>Extraordinary</hi> or <hi>Preternatural</hi> Changes in the <hi>Courſe</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> during theſe Six Thouſand Years.</p>
                  <p>One, when that <hi>Luminary</hi> ſtood ſtill in the Time of <hi>Jehoſhua, General</hi> of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi> to ſerve the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Light of the Day to a double Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, till the Oppoſite Army was quite deſtroy'd, and not one of the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That Day prov'd a long Night to their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes.</hi> They turn'd themſelves in their Beds, when they had out-ſlept the Uſual Hours of Night, and ſaid in their Hearts, <hi>Surely the</hi> Sun <hi>is fall'n Aſleep, or is Banqueting with the</hi> Gods <hi>of the</hi> Sea. <hi>Perhaps</hi> Thetis <hi>detains him in her Embraces, whilſt the</hi> Tritons <hi>faſten his Slumbers with their ſofteſt Muſick: Or</hi> Neptune
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102962:62"/>
                     <hi>regales him in the Palaces of the Deep.</hi> Thus the Diſconſolate <hi>Nations</hi> argu'd in their Chambers. They were alarm'd with Fears of Unknown Events.</p>
                  <p>Such as dwelt on the Borders of the Earth, and were accuſtom'd to mark the conſtant <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flowing</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> admir'd the Delay of the Uſual Tides, and ask'd, <hi>What what was become of the Moon?</hi> for, that <hi>Planet</hi> alſo, ſtood ſtill with the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Light of their Souls was Eclips'd, and their Reaſon labour'd under a greater Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than that which troubl'd their Eyes. They were Ignorant of the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and knew not, that the <hi>Celeſtial Orbs</hi> ſtood ſtill at the Command of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which formed them, even at the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Prophet</hi> Inſpir'd from <hi>Above.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in the Days of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> went back in his Circuit, and all the <hi>Frame</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> was Retrograde, to confirm the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Good News, when he told the Sick King, <hi>That Fate had prolong'd his Life for Fifteen Years.</hi> This was in the Days of <hi>Merodach Baladan,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> who ſent <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> to congratulate <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Miraculous Recovery.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, nothing has happen'd to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or any of the <hi>Heavenly Bodies,</hi> beyond the Ordinary Courſe of <hi>Nature.</hi> A Man may as well Prognoſticate from Cloudy Weather, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of <hi>Emperors</hi> and Meaner Men, as from the <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon:</hi> Since, the <hi>One</hi> as well as the <hi>Other,</hi> obſcures the Light

                  <p>Let us pray <hi>Heaven,</hi> to grant us the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Uſe of our <hi>Senſes,</hi> and not to <hi>Eclipſe</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> of our <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and we need fear no <hi>Diſaſters,</hi> from the <hi>Common Appearances</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>

                  <p>PArdon my Importunity, if I this once trouble thee with an Addreſs of Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, begging thy Counſel in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of my <hi>Soul.</hi> I ſeem to my ſelf as a Traveller loſt in a Wilderneſs of Doubts and Uncertainties, without Guide or Conduct. Not that I queſtion the Truth of our <hi>Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:102962:64"/>or miſtruſt the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Sent</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Certainly, I revere the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory,</hi> whoſe <hi>Sacred Verſicles,</hi> are tranſcribed on my Heart. But, there is wanting to every Man, a particular Conduct in the Intricacies of this Life. I have not the Art of applying the General <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> to my Own Perſonal Occaſions and Neceſſities. Infinite Difficulties ariſe from my daily Affairs. My Converſation with <hi>Infidels,</hi> and the Duty I owe my <hi>Great Maſter,</hi> entangle my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. I am embaraſſed on all Hands; and whilſt I ſtudy to conſerve Purity, I find my ſelf ſtill defiled.</p>
                  <p>I am no <hi>Heretick,</hi> nor in the Number of thoſe who are <hi>Predeſtinated</hi> to be <hi>Damned,</hi> for the Injurious Love they bear to <hi>Hali;</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, I ſay, becauſe it derogates from the Honour they owe to <hi>Omar, Oſman</hi> and <hi>Ebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becher,</hi> the True Succeſſors of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As I firmly believe the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſo I give an entire <hi>Faith</hi> to the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Aſſonah,</hi> or the <hi>Agreement</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe;</hi> with the <hi>Writings</hi> of the Four Principal <hi>Imaums, Haniff, Schaſi, Melechi</hi> and <hi>Hambeli.</hi> And I am reſigned to the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Mufti,</hi> as our <hi>Fathers</hi> were of <hi>Old,</hi> to the <hi>Oraculous</hi> Determinations of the <hi>Babylonion Califfs.</hi> I Curſe the <hi>Kyzil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſchi</hi> with as much Devotion, as I pray for the Health and Felicity of <hi>True Believers.</hi> I ſpit at the Naming of them, who deny the <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Covering,</hi> and the <hi>Verſicles</hi> brought down by the <hi>Squire</hi> of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102962:64"/>Honour of the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Wife. I never lifted up my Hand againſt any who deſcended from the <hi>Divine Meſſenger.</hi> And if in my Paſſion, I have ever Curs'd a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> I took of the Duſt under his Feet, and laid it on my Lips, before the Shadow of the Sun had advanc'd a Hairs-Breadth; and ſo I hindred the ſwift <hi>Recorder</hi> of our Words, from Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Imprecation. For, that Duſt, I believe, has Power to blot out the Memorials, of our Evil Words and Works.</p>
                  <p>When I meet a <hi>Santone,</hi> or one of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely Mad, I put in Practice the Leſſon of <hi>Orchanes;</hi> and honouring the <hi>Holy Frantick,</hi> I fall down and Adore <hi>Vertue,</hi> in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Diſguiſe.</p>
                  <p>I neglect none of the <hi>Purifications,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Our <hi>Holy Lawgiver;</hi> but rather add thoſe, that we <hi>Arabians</hi> have received by Tradition from our <hi>Fathers,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael:</hi> Yet, I hope, in Caſe of Neglect, ſome Indulgence is allowable to a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> in a Country of <hi>Infidels.</hi> I uſe the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>Abdeſt</hi> at all Times in my Chamber, where no Curious Eye can obſerve my Cleanlineſs; or Suſpicious Apprehenſion, draw Concluſions of my being a <hi>Mahometan.</hi> But I cannot thus practiſe the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>Taharet;</hi> there being not ſuch Conveniences for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in <hi>Paris,</hi> as in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Yet, I am careful to ſupply this Want, by other Methods of Purity; otherwiſe, I ſhould be an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to my ſelf. There is no Neceſſity, that I ſhould frequent the <hi>Bath,</hi> who never touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102962:65"/>a Woman: Yet, I often go into the River, taking a Boat with me for that End, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing my ſelf to be rowed half a League from the City, where in a little Bay or Creek, I waſh my whole Body, that I may do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond the Obligations of the <hi>Law,</hi> to expiate the Involuntary Breaches of my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yet, after all this, I cannot call my ſelf <hi>Clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I <hi>Pray</hi> at the Appointed Hours; Or, at leaſt, if the Affairs of my <hi>Commiſſion</hi> hinder me from complying with the <hi>Law,</hi> as to the exact Times of the Day, I atone for that Neglect, by <hi>Watching</hi> the greateſt Part of the Night. And, to the <hi>Oraiſons</hi> appointed by <hi>Authority,</hi> I add <hi>Supernumerary Prayers</hi> of my own, to evidence the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of my <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I <hi>Faſt,</hi> and give <hi>Alms,</hi> according to my Ability. I beſtow much Time, in Reading and Meditating on the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> In a word, I do all that my Reaſon tells me is Neceſſary, to render me a Good <hi>Muſſulman;</hi> and yet, I have no Peace in my Mind. Methinks, I ſee Our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> furrowing his Brows at me, and darting angry Looks from his <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi> He ſeems to reproach me with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs and Infidelity. By Day my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination troubles me; and at Night, I am Terrify'd with Fearful Dreams. Which makes me conclude, That notwithſtanding all my Obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> and the ſtricteſt Care I take, to acquit my ſelf a <hi>True Believer,</hi> yet I am far ſhort of my Aim; and therefore, I number my ſelf with thoſe, with whom <hi>God</hi> is diſpleaſed.</p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102962:65"/>
                  <p>It is impoſſible to expreſs the Horror, which this Thought creates in me. I am overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometimes, with Melancholy and Deſpair. And, becauſe I am forc'd to keep my Grief to my ſelf, without having the Privilege of Venting it to a Boſom Friend, it is ready to burſt my Heart.</p>
                  <p>This is my Condition at Certain Seaſons; which I eſteem as bad, or worſe, than thoſe who are Doom'd to <hi>Aaraf.</hi> For as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy the Felicities of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſo they are ſecured from the Torments of the Damn'd: Whereas, for ought I know, my Portion may be in <hi>Hell.</hi> Wilt thou know how I redreſs this Evil Temper of Mind, and what Method I take to cure my Melancholy? Receive it not as Flattery, when I tell thee, Thou art my Phyſician, and the <hi>Idea</hi> of thy Innocent Life, my Medicine. When I have rowl'd over Ten Thouſand Thoughts, which afford me no Eaſe or Relief, no ſooner do I fix my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation on the <hi>Solitary</hi> of Mount <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel,</hi> but a ſudden Beam of Light and Comfort, glances through my Soul. I promiſe my ſelf greater Satisfaction from thy Advice, than from all the <hi>Imaums</hi> and <hi>Mollahs</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tell me therefore, O <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Pious Eremit,</hi> how I ſhall diſſipate theſe Miſts of Grief and Sadneſs, which envelop my Mind, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſuffocate my Intellect.</p>
                  <p>If in this Darkneſs and Confuſion, I ſhould apply my ſelf to the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Alhazan</hi> for Inſtruction, they will puzzle me with Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102962:66"/>Niceties, about the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Whereas, I am too much troubled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, with diſtracting Speculations. I ſeek not to dive into that which is <hi>Incomprehenſible,</hi> but to be Inſtructed in the Plain and Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Way to <hi>Happineſs.</hi> What Imports it, Whether <hi>God</hi> be <hi>Good</hi> by his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or by his <hi>Eſſence?</hi> This is, to throw <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> Duſt in my Eyes, and ſo leave me in a worſe Condition than they found me.</p>
                  <p>No better Light, muſt I expect from the <hi>Momſconderan:</hi> For, if they are ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo am I, where the <hi>Precepts</hi> are applicable to my Condition and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. But, I want a Direction in many Emergencies, for which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſeems to have made no Proviſion, but leaves every Man, to the Conduct of his own Prudence. And, I muſt confeſs, I dare not truſt mine, in all Caſes of this Nature. Beſides, inſtead of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting to me in a plain Style the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> they will Confound me with High and Unintelligible Notions of the <hi>Divine Attributes,</hi> which are ſufficient to dazle the Intellect of the Brighteſt <hi>Seraphim.</hi> And, if they could once perſwade me to be zealous for their Speculations, I might in Time turn ſuch another Religious Fool, as was one of their <hi>Followers,</hi> the <hi>Poet Namiſi,</hi> who being wrapt in his profound Speculations of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and hearing an <hi>Imaum</hi> pronounce the <hi>Sacred Sentence, God</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> gave him the Lye, and told him, That he multiply'd the <hi>Divinity,</hi> in aſſigning it any <hi>Attribute,</hi> though
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102962:66"/>it were onely that which expreſſed his <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> For which Impudent Aſſertion, he was flea'd Alive.</p>
                  <p>In as bad a Condition ſhould I be, if I ask'd the Advice of the <hi>Muſerin,</hi> thoſe <hi>Infidels</hi> in Maſquerade, who under the Diſguiſe of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> deny the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> aſſert all Things to come by Chance, and live without Hope or Faith of Another Life. For, if this were true, that there were no Reward or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Good or Bad Works, I would either ſoon make my Way to Earthly Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by not boggling at any Vice that would conduce to that End; Or, if I fail'd in that Attempt, I would not tamely wait for a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom</hi> from Men, but bravely rid my ſelf of a Life, which was attended with Nothing but Miſery.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt as bad as theſe, are the <hi>Hairet,</hi> thoſe <hi>Mahometan Scepticks,</hi> who dare not truſt their own Reaſon, but are ever Wavering and Irreſolute. If I ſhould ſeek for Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at their Hands, they would anſwer me, <hi>God knows beſt what I ought to do,</hi> and ſo leave me in the ſame Suſpence as I was before.</p>
                  <p>Much Worſe are the <hi>Guaid,</hi> thoſe Moroſe Interpreters of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> who damn a Man Irrecoverably to <hi>Hell,</hi> for committing one Mortal Sin. This is enough to drive all Mankind to Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the <hi>Morals</hi> of the <hi>Sabin</hi> pleaſe me, who ſeem to be perfect <hi>Mahometan Stoicks,</hi> aſcribing all Events to <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> and the <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of the <hi>Stars.</hi> I could willingly embrace
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102962:67"/>the Advice of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who appear ſo void of Paſſion; but I could never join with them, in Adoring the Sun, Moon and Conſtellations of <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> has expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it. And, were there no ſuch Prohibition, my own Reaſon would convince me, that I ought as well to Adore the Fire for warming me and ſerving my other Neceſſities, or the Water for quenching my Thirſt and Purifying me, or my own Hands for feeding me, as to pay theſe Divine Honours to the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Bodies; ſince the one, as well as the other, Act according to their Nature.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, of all the Innumerable <hi>Sects,</hi> into which the <hi>Muſſulman Empire</hi> is divided, I cannot expect entire Satisfaction from any; for, if they appear Orthodox in Some <hi>Tenets,</hi> in Others they are manifeſtly <hi>Heretical.</hi> Yet, I cannot but ſet a higher Value on Some, than Others, as their Doctrines and Practices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer to Reaſon and Truth. For, I am not yet ſuch an <hi>Academick,</hi> as to ask that Mock-Queſtion, <hi>What is Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, our <hi>Fathers</hi> knew it, and the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was ſent to Divulge it on Earth. But, if Ignorance, Superſtition and Error have baniſhed it from <hi>Courts</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> let us ſeek it in the <hi>Deſarts.</hi> Perhaps we may find this Wanderer among the Rocks and Woods; or, 'tis poſſible She has ſheltered her ſelf in ſome Den or Cave, as hoping for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Favour from the Wild Beaſts, than from the Society of Men.</p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102962:67"/>
                  <p>If <hi>Truth</hi> be no where to be found Entire, but has divided her ſelf among the Different <hi>Religions</hi> and <hi>Sects</hi> in the World, then, rather than miſs of this <hi>Divine</hi> Jewel, I will ſearch for it in Fragments; and whatſoever is Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Pious in any <hi>Sect,</hi> I will embrace, without concerning my ſelf in their Follies and Vices.</p>
                  <p>After all, the <hi>Munaſihi</hi> ſeem to me, the onely Orthodox and Illuminated of <hi>God,</hi> who declining the private By-Ways of <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> walk in the High Road of Priſtine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Piety, following the Steps of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and obeying the Traditions which know no Origin. Among theſe, thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareſt as another <hi>Pythagoras;</hi> confirming them by thy Example in an Innocent Life; enduring the utmoſt Severities of Abſtinence, rather than be Guilty of ſhedding the Blood of thoſe Creatures, which the <hi>Great Lord</hi> of <hi>All Things</hi> Created, to enjoy the Herbage of the Field, and to partake of the Common Bleſſings of <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as We.</p>
                  <p>To thee therefore I have Recourſe, as to an <hi>Oracle.</hi> Tell me, O <hi>Sacred Sylvan,</hi> am I not obliged to obey the Inſpirations of my <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Better Genius,</hi> which tells me, 'Tis a Butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly and Inhuman Life, to feed on ſlaughte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Animals? Did not all thoſe who aim'd at <hi>Perfection,</hi> among the <hi>Primitive Diſciples</hi> of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> abſtain from Murdering the Brutes? 'Tis true, the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> did not poſitively enjoin <hi>Abſtinence</hi> from <hi>Fleſh;</hi> yet he recommended it, as a <hi>Divine Counſel.</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102962:68"/>And, thoſe to whom he Indulged the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Eating it, he ty'd up to certain Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Do not all the <hi>Religious Orders</hi> Preach up <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> both in their <hi>Sermons</hi> and <hi>Lives?</hi> I make no longer Doubt, but the Corruption of Manners, and Voluptuouſneſs of Men, are the Cauſes, that this <hi>Ancient</hi> Sobriety is now diſus'd and ſlighted. My own Experience confirms me in this Opinion, who have often attempted to live in <hi>Abſtinence;</hi> but, by the Force of a Voracious Appetite, ſuffered my ſelf to be carry'd back to my Old Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Yet, in Eating Fleſh, I have been preciſely careful, to obſerve the Prohibitions of our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet,</hi> ſo long as it was in my Power. I never <hi>Knowingly</hi> taſted of <hi>Blood,</hi> nor of any Thing <hi>Strangled</hi> or <hi>knocked down.</hi> But, it is Impoſſible for me to <hi>Aſſure</hi> my ſelf of this; or that all the Fleſh I Eat, was <hi>kill'd,</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing that <hi>Tremendous Name</hi> which gave it <hi>Life.</hi> Neither could I Once eſcape a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of Eating <hi>Swines Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, I abominate my ſelf for this Involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Crime. And, to obviate the like Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation for the Future, I will taſte of Nothing, that has Breath'd the Common Air; being inclined to believe the <hi>Metempſychoſis:</hi> Which, if it be true, I wiſh for no greater Happineſs, than that in my Next Change, my <hi>Soul</hi> may paſs into the Body of the <hi>Camel,</hi> which ſhall carry thee to <hi>Mecha.</hi>

                  <p>MY Intelligence from the <hi>Imperial Port,</hi> ſometimes arrives late; either through the Neglect of <hi>Kiſur Dramelec,</hi> to whom that Care is committed, or through the Badneſs of the Roads, which many Times are Impaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Beſides the frequent Stops and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the <hi>Poſts,</hi> in this Time of <hi>War.</hi> Which is the Reaſon, I do not always hear of the <hi>Alterations</hi> at the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> that are made in the <hi>Governments</hi> of the <hi>Shining Empire,</hi> till many <hi>Moons</hi> are paſs'd. Who is exalted, or who made <hi>Manſoul,</hi> are Things to which <hi>Mahmut</hi> is for a Time a great Stranger.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, thou haſt no Reaſon to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that I am thus late in ſending to thee my Congratulatory Addreſs. But reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that I wiſh thee encreaſe of Happineſs, like the <hi>Sprouting</hi> of the <hi>Palm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a Mark of my Duty and Affection, I ſhall now acquaint thee with News, which though it may ſeem of ſmall Import to the <hi>Divan,</hi> yet has ſtartl'd all <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Impriſonment of Three of the <hi>French Princes;</hi> not thoſe of the <hi>Ordinary Rank,</hi> but <hi>Branches</hi> of the <hi>Royal Stem,</hi> whoſe Names are not unknown in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the <hi>Reſidence</hi> of <hi>Fame.</hi> They are, the <hi>Princes</hi> of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102962:69"/>
                     <hi>Conde</hi> and <hi>Conti,</hi> Brothers, and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Longueville,</hi> Husband to their Siſter. They are the Principal Subjects in this <hi>Nation;</hi> all Three, having the <hi>Majeſtick Blood</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> running in their Veins.</p>
                  <p>They owe their Confinement to <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> or rather to their own Inartificial Conduct. The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> is a Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Man; and has never learn'd, how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his Reſentments. When he firſt return'd from the Battel of <hi>Lens</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereof I formerly gave an Account, the <hi>Inſurrection</hi> in <hi>Paris</hi> began. The <hi>Prince</hi> block'd up the City, and promis'd the <hi>Cardinal</hi> (againſt whom alone all this Storm was rais'd) that he wou'd either bring him back in Triumph to <hi>Paris,</hi> or die in the Attempt. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd his Word; and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> rode through the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the ſame Coach with the King, Queen, and all the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> after the Siege was rais'd, and a <hi>Peace</hi> concluded. And the <hi>Prince,</hi> when he alighted out of the Coach, addreſs'd himſelf thus to the <hi>Cardinal: Now, Sir, I eſteem my ſelf the happieſt Man in the World, in that I have been able to perform my Engagement, in bringing Your</hi> Eminence <hi>back to</hi> Paris; <hi>and that by my Preſence, the Hatred which the Multitude have for your Perſon, was repreſs'd whilſt we paſs'd through the Streets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This too nearly touch'd the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> And indeed the Queen, with all the Reſt, were ſenſible, that the <hi>Prince</hi> had too far over-ſhot himſelf, in this laſt Expreſſion. However, the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102962:69"/>
                     <hi>Cardinal</hi> reply'd in a Kind of Modeſty, not wholly void of Choler and Diſdain; <hi>Sir, You have not only oblig'd me to that Height, but have done the</hi> Kingdom <hi>ſo conſiderable a Service in this Action, That I fear, neither their</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties <hi>nor my ſelf, ſhall be ever in a State, to make you anſwerable Compenſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who ſtood by, and heard theſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Diſcourſes, were apt to interpret the <hi>Firſt</hi> for a Reproach, and the <hi>Second</hi> as a Menace. Since it is not unuſual for Great Men, to over-value the Services they do their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country;</hi> and for <hi>Princes,</hi> when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not duely reward an Eminent Performance, to turn their Gratitude into Hatred.</p>
                  <p>This is certain, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> has preſum'd much, on the Merit of his late Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and, it was not eaſy for the <hi>Queen</hi> or the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> to invent ſuch Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he expected. For he imagin'd, they ought to deny him Nothing, who had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hazarded his Life for their Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>It was on this Ground, he thought he had a Right to interpoſe in a Marriage, which <hi>Mazarini</hi> deſign'd to make between one of his <hi>Nieces,</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mercaeur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Duke</hi> is of a <hi>Family,</hi> which has been a long Time at Variance with that of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde:</hi> And therefore, the <hi>Prince</hi> was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous leſt the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> by the intended <hi>Match,</hi> ſhould fortifie his Intereſt among the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Enemies; and ſo be in a Condition, not to want his Protection; the onely Thing he was ambitious of. For, cou'd he have once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102962:70"/>the <hi>Cardinal</hi> to this Neceſſity, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been abſolute <hi>Maſter</hi> at <hi>Court.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he oppos'd the <hi>Match,</hi> with all Vigor and Induſtry. This netled the <hi>Cardinal.</hi> He complains to the <hi>Queen,</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs. She intercedes, and uſes her utmoſt Endeavours, to reconcile the <hi>Prince</hi> to this Marriage. But his Brother, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,</hi> had ſo poſſeſs'd the <hi>Prince</hi> with a Jealouſy of the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Proceedings, that no Arguments cou'd prevail on him, or overcome his fix'd Averſion for <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s deſigned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance</hi> with the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> (ſo they call the <hi>Family,</hi> from whence the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeur</hi> is ſprung.) He rails at the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and lampoons him in all Companies. This begets ill Blood in the <hi>Supreme Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> who ſecretly reſolves the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Ruin.</p>
                  <p>In this, his Policy and Malice, exceeded the petty Revenges of the <hi>Prince;</hi> who being of a frank, open Heart, contented himſelf with Railleries, and Satyrical Expreſſions, whilſt the <hi>Cardinal</hi> conceal'd his Anger, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Maſque of extraordinary Civilities; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning all the Contempts of the <hi>Prince,</hi> with a Reſpect, which ſeem'd to ſpeak much Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Devoir.</p>
                  <p>He has been a long Time tampering with a <hi>Faction,</hi> which goes by the Name of the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs.</hi> Theſe were his Enemies, not ſo much in Hatred of his Perſon, as out of a Zeal to ſerve their <hi>Country,</hi> which they imagin'd, was oppreſs'd under the the Conduct of this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:102962:70"/>
                  <p>Theſe he has lately gain'd over to his <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> by repreſenting to them the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> as the Author of all thoſe Evils, which they aſcrib'd to himſelf: Whilſt at the ſame Time, he perſwaded the <hi>Prince,</hi> that they had ſome Deſign againſt his Perſon. Thus he artificially blinded both <hi>Parties,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd them in mutual Revenges; privately animating the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> againſt the <hi>Prince,</hi> and provoking the <hi>Prince,</hi> to ſeek the Ruin of the <hi>Frondeurs.</hi> By this Trap, the <hi>Prince</hi> was inveigl'd to conſent, and give Orders for his own <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> whilſt he was made to believe, the <hi>Arreſt</hi> was deſign'd againſt his Enemies; and the People were ſatisfy'd, ſince they were perſwaded, the <hi>Faction</hi> of the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deurs</hi> had a Hand in the <hi>Plot.</hi>

                  <p>The 18th. of the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> the Three <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were taken into <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> and ſent to a Place, they call the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciennes,</hi> ſome Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi> The ſame Day, the <hi>Queen</hi> ſent for the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville</hi> to come to her; but, the wary <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs,</hi> wou'd not put herſelf into a <hi>Cage.</hi> She immediately fled in Diſguiſe, to a <hi>Sea-Town</hi> belonging to her Husband.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> had Notice given him, of his Deſign'd Impriſonment; but that he wou'd not eſcape, projecting to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſome greater Advantages, from the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the <hi>People</hi> (who now behold him as a <hi>Patriot</hi>) than from a Clandeſtine, or Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Liberty.

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:102962:71"/>and 'tis thought, his Friends might eaſily have reſcu'd him: For, this Accident, occaſion'd a Stop of Six Hours in their Journey; Time enough to have rais'd a Thouſand Men to his Relief, being onely guarded by Sixteen <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers.</hi> But it ſeems, he courts the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>'s Perſecution, that he may have deeper Grounds for Revenge. I know not, whether his Policy is juſtifiable, or no: But if I were in his Circumſtances, I ſhou'd hardly take this Method to gratify my Reſentments; which in all Probability I ſhou'd not be in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to accompliſh, till the <hi>Greek Calends,</hi> that is, <hi>Never.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Devotees</hi> among the <hi>Franks,</hi> talk much of the <hi>Jubilee</hi> that is to be Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated this Year at <hi>Rome.</hi> They enrich their Phancies, with the Hopes of I know not what <hi>Spiritual Treaſure,</hi> which the <hi>Roman Mufti</hi> or <hi>Pontiff,</hi> will diſtribute among the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> that reſort to <hi>Rome,</hi> during this <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:102962:71"/>
                  <p>This, as I am told, is Celebrated in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Sabbatical Year,</hi> formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they poſſeſs'd the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew Writers,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Joſephus</hi> and others, call That alſo the <hi>Year</hi> of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> Their <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> like the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> pretended to derive Great <hi>Myſteries</hi> from certain <hi>Numbers:</hi> And the Number <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> was had in particular Veneration by the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Therefore they kept every <hi>Seventh</hi> Day, Week and Year, <hi>Holy.</hi> In the <hi>Seventh</hi> Year it was not Lawful to till the Ground, plant Vineyards, or ſow any Seed. And when <hi>Seven</hi> Times <hi>Seven</hi> Years were expired, the Year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> was proclaim'd, being always the <hi>Fiftieth.</hi> They proclaim'd it by Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, throughout the whole Country of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> in the Forty Ninth Year. And the <hi>Muezins</hi> cry'd in the Gates of their Cities and <hi>Synagogues,</hi> at the Beginning of the <hi>Jubilee:</hi> 
                     <q>Let every Man return this Year to his Own <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> and <hi>Tribe,</hi> whether he be a <hi>Slave</hi> or <hi>Free.</hi> He that has ſold his Houſes or Lands, if he was not before able to redeem them, let him this Year take Poſſeſſion of his Inheritance. He that is become another Man's <hi>Slave,</hi> and neither himſelf nor his Friends can redeem him, let him this Year be diſmiſs'd, and ſent Home to the Family to which he belongs; for, henceforth he is <hi>Free,</hi> by the <hi>Indulgence</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> Let no Man ſow the Ground, nor gather the Fruits that grow of themſelves this Year. But, let the Earth as well as its Inhabitants, enjoy Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102962:72"/>and Reſt; for, this is the <hi>Year</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Divine Bounty.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Manner was the <hi>Hebrew Jubilee</hi> Proclaim'd, and Obſerv'd. And, they ſay, from hence aroſe the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> amongſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who in many Things may be ſtyl'd the <hi>Jews</hi> Apes. But others ſay, that the preſent <hi>Roman Jubilee,</hi> is deriv'd from the <hi>Secular Games,</hi> Celebrated by their <hi>Pagan</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; In Regard, This was renew'd every Hundred Years at firſt, even as Thoſe <hi>Games</hi> were. Whence it was, that the <hi>Cryer</hi> in thoſe Days, at the <hi>Indiction</hi> of the <hi>Secular Games,</hi> ſaid, "Come to the <hi>Plays</hi> which no Man Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving has yet ſeen, nor ſhall ever ſee again. For, Man's Life being Generally ſo Short, they thought it improbable, that any <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> ſhould live to ſee this <hi>Solemnity</hi> repeated.</p>
                  <p>The Modern <hi>Jubilee,</hi> was firſt Publiſh'd by <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year 1300 of the <hi>Chriſtians Hegyra.</hi> At which Time, he promis'd Full and Entire <hi>Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of <hi>Sins,</hi> to all who ſhould reſort in <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> that Year. After him, it was Celebrated every Hundred Year, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Inſtitution, till the Days of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> VI. Who, at the Inſtance of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Citizens, reduc'd it to every Fiftieth Year. Then <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VI. another <hi>Pope,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd it to the Thirty Third Year. And laſt of all, <hi>Paul</hi> II. contracted the Interval to Five and Twenty Years. Which Space of Time, has been obſerv'd by all his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> to this Day.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102962:72"/>
                  <p>If thou wouldſt know the Reaſon, why they have thus alter'd the <hi>Periods;</hi> It is for Profit. For, in the Year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> there is a vaſt Conflux of People, from all Parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> Who bring a far greater Treaſure into the Roman Coffers, than they carry away from that City. Though the <hi>Pope,</hi> 'tis ſaid, is very Liberal of that which they call the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> Which is a certain <hi>Fund</hi> of <hi>Merits,</hi> and <hi>Superabundant Graces,</hi> left by the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and his <hi>Saints,</hi> in the Cuſtody of this <hi>Prelate,</hi> to ſupply the Defects and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of Sinful Men. And they believe, 'tis only in his Power, to diſpoſe of this <hi>Heavenly Wealth</hi> to whom he pleaſes. They talk alſo of <hi>Indulgencies</hi> and <hi>Pardons,</hi> whereby the <hi>Holy Father</hi> can redeem Men from all Sin, and the Puniſhments that are due to it. And this Wonderful Prerogative, they ſay, does not only benefit the <hi>Living,</hi> but extends even to the <hi>Souls Departed;</hi> whom the <hi>Pope,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Perſuaſion, can free from the <hi>Torments</hi> of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and at his Pleaſure admit into the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We that are <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> cannot declaim againſt the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Praying</hi> for the <hi>Dead,</hi> ſince it is practis'd by all the <hi>Faithful.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we Reaſon to inveigh againſt <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies,</hi> or <hi>Releaſes</hi> from <hi>Penance.</hi> But that the Power of granting and diſpenſing theſe Favours, ſhould be only repoſited in the <hi>Chriſtian Mufti,</hi> will not accord with the <hi>Faith</hi> of a <hi>True Believer.</hi> We know who ſwore by the <hi>Hoofs</hi> of his <hi>Swift</hi> and <hi>Faithful
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102962:73"/>Elborach,</hi> which in One Night carry'd him a Journey of <hi>Six Moons,</hi> that from thenceforth the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>Aaraf,</hi> or the <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Priſons,</hi> was committed to him. Doubtleſs, the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi> can transfer his <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> when and to whom he pleaſes. If he once gave this Authority, of <hi>Remitting Sins,</hi> to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> his <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> does it follow, that all <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> the <hi>Califfs</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> have retain'd this <hi>Privilege?</hi> There have been many <hi>Good</hi> Men in that Seat, and not a Few <hi>Wicked:</hi> Some <hi>Prophets,</hi> and ſome <hi>Magicians:</hi> A <hi>Catalogue</hi> interpers'd with <hi>Saints, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, Butchers</hi> and <hi>Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'tis evident, they forfeited their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when they declin'd from the Truth, from the unblameable Profeſſion of the <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and reſiſted the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſent to correct their Errors, reform their Vices, and reduce Mankind to <hi>One Law</hi> of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I write not Partially, nor am I imbitter'd againſt the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi> He is a Man like others, ſubject to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny.</hi> The <hi>Babylonian Califfs</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Succeſſively enjoy'd the ſame Power, tranſmitted to them from the <hi>Prophet,</hi> who ſeal'd up all the Former <hi>Diſpenſations.</hi> Yet in Time, through their Sins, they forfeited their Authority, together with their <hi>Empire,</hi> when the <hi>Bright Oſmans</hi> Conquer'd <hi>All Things.</hi> Then was the <hi>Prophetick Office</hi> tranſlated to our <hi>Mufti,</hi> the <hi>Guide</hi> of thoſe who poſſeſs the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> To him all the <hi>World</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But all Mortals, are Naturally tenacious of whatſoever advances their Honour and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. <hi>Kings</hi> hug <hi>Empty Titles,</hi> that yield them no Profit.

                  <p>In ſpeaking to <hi>Perſons</hi> of thy <hi>Immenſe Power,</hi> I ſtrive equally to ſhun Flattery, and Diſreſpect; endeavouring to deport my ſelf

                  <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> Celebrates thy Praiſes, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols thy Juſtice, for releaſing the <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> Impriſon'd in the 4th <hi>Moon</hi> of this Year.

                  <p>Here is much Talk, about the Defeat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Our Forces in <hi>Hungary.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſpare for no <hi>Encomium's</hi> on the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> who fought valiantly, till his Legs were ſhot off; and then caus'd himſelf to be carry'd up and down through the Army, to encourage his Soldiers.

                  <p>But they blame the Conduct of him who Beſieg'd the <hi>Fort</hi> of <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> in Regard he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook it in the Wrong <hi>Seaſon</hi> of the Year. The Defect of a <hi>General</hi>'s Judgment in ſuch Caſes, is many Times Fatal to an Army.

Moſt of their <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnes,</hi> are ſpent in their Trenches, or in light Skirmiſhes; ſeldom hazarding a Battle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

                  <p>THOU wilt have Reaſon to wonder at a Man pretending Acquaintance with thee, whom thou canſt not remember to have ſeen. 'Tis from my Brother <hi>Peſtelihali,</hi> thy former <hi>Maſter,</hi> I received the News of thy late <hi>Preferment,</hi> who art thy ſelf but Early in Years. Yet no Time is Unſeaſonable, to a Man Mature in Vertue and Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>I knew thee an Infant, in the Arms of thy Mother, the Widow of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Souldier, who ſerved my Brother in the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> There appeared then, ſuch Evident Symptoms of thy future Wit and Dexterity, as prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy Father's <hi>Captain,</hi> to take thee into his Protection and Care; and thy Mother by her Charms, ſoon found a Way to his Boſom.</p>
                  <p>I write not theſe Things, to Reproach thee with the <hi>Meanneſs</hi> of thy <hi>Birth.</hi> Thy <hi>Merits</hi> equal thee with thoſe who are born of <hi>Nobles.</hi> It is not the Cuſtom of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to Prefer Men for their <hi>Parentage,</hi> or becauſe they can ſhew the <hi>Duſty Statues</hi> of their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</hi> That is the peculiar Overſight of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> to give that Honour to <hi>Names,</hi> and Men of a <hi>Noiſy Deſcent,</hi> which is only due to <hi>Vertue.</hi> There are <hi>Families</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was no Contemptible Jeſt, which was in this Manner put upon the preſent <hi>Pope,</hi> and one of his <hi>Nephews,</hi> at the latter End of the laſt Year. It ſeems, the Good Old <hi>Father</hi> had advanced this <hi>Spark,</hi> from a Poor Ignorant <hi>Taylor,</hi> to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of a <hi>Roman Baron;</hi> beſtowing on him <hi>Offices,</hi> which brought him a <hi>Revenue,</hi> ſufficient to maintain his <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Port.</hi> All the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Nobility,</hi> were diſguſted at this: And ſome arch <hi>Wag</hi> was ſet at Work, to ridicule the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Conduct, and the New <hi>Baron</hi>'s Honour. Wherefore, on the Day which the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> Celebrate, with Great Solemnity, for the <hi>Birth-Day</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> Early in the Morning, the forementioned Image, <hi>Paſquil,</hi> was obſerved to be Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd all in Rags, and a very naſty Habit,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102962:77"/>with a <hi>Schedule</hi> of Paper in his Hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was writ, <hi>How now</hi> Paſquil; <hi>what! all in Rags on a</hi> Chriſtmas-<hi>Day?</hi> (for, ſo they call the <hi>Nativity</hi> of their <hi>Meſſias.</hi>) And Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath was Inſcribed this Anſwer: <hi>Alas, I cannot help it; for my</hi> TAYLOR <hi>is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a</hi> LORD.</p>

                  <p>By what I have ſaid, thou may'ſt be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that I have not the Leſs Eſteem for thee, becauſe thou waſt not the Son of a <hi>Baſſa;</hi> ſince, had thy Father liv'd, his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Courage might have promoted him to that <hi>Honour,</hi> or a <hi>Command</hi> equal to it; and thou thy ſelf art in a fair Way, to ſupply ſome Future Vacancy, in thoſe Great <hi>Charges</hi> of the <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have no News at preſent to ſend thee, ſave that the Three <hi>French</hi> Princes, of whoſe Impriſonment I gave an Account to <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim Aluph,</hi> are removed by <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi>'s Order, from the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of <hi>Vinciennes,</hi> to a <hi>Sea-Town</hi> called <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> for Fear they ſhould be reſcued by <hi>Marſhall Turenne,</hi> who is much Devoted to their Intereſts.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102962:78"/>having alſo with her the Young <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien,</hi> her Son.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marſhal de la Meilleray,</hi> is gone with his Army to beſiege this Place; and, 'tis ſaid, the King will ſoon Follow with the Whole <hi>Court.</hi> All Things ſeem to protend another Relapſe of this <hi>State,</hi> into the <hi>Old Diſorders.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>GRaphul Eben Shahenſhah,</hi> the <hi>Arabian Philoſopher</hi> has ſaid it, and every Mans Experience confirms it, That no <hi>Humane</hi> Care can prevent the Accompliſhment of what <hi>Heaven</hi> has <hi>Decreed.</hi> There are certain Moments of our Lives, wherein <hi>Fate</hi> delights to mock our Wit and Prudence, to baffle our ſtricteſt Caution, and ridicule all our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; That we may learn the Leſſon of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation,</hi> and not truſt too much to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>When I firſt ſaluted the Light of this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun, my Spirits were Serene and Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: No melancholy Dreams, had left their Black Impreſſions on my Mind; no ſadning Thoughts, poſſeſs'd my Soul: I awak'd cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſprightly as the Lark. After I had Ador'd the <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and perform'd my Accuſtom'd <hi>Holy Things,</hi> I began to reflect on my own Happineſs, in that I had ſo many Years ſerv'd the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> in this <hi>Station,</hi> full of Difficulties and Perils, yet by no Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, had ever betray'd the leaſt Secret of my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> It pleas'd me to think, I ſtill paſs'd for <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> among the <hi>French,</hi> who are the moſt apprehenſive Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World; and even in the Opinion of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> who, like <hi>Janus,</hi> has
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102962:79"/>more Eyes than Two. I Embrac'd my ſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) in the Conceit of my Good Succeſs; concluding, I was born under <hi>Fortunate Stars,</hi> and that no Diſaſter could ever hurt me.</p>
                  <p>But I took wrong Meaſures of the <hi>Ways</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny,</hi> which are as Untraceable as the Winds. For before Mid-Day, my <hi>Sun</hi> was <hi>Eclips'd;</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> of my <hi>Soul</hi> ruffl'd with <hi>Storms,</hi> and all my <hi>Joy</hi> turn'd to <hi>Mourning</hi> and <hi>Sadneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wilt thou know the Occaſion of my Grief? It was this. In the Year 1645, according to the <hi>Style</hi> of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> I received ſome particular Inſtructions from the then <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> putting me in Mind of the Hazards I run in this Poſt, and giving me ſtrict Charge, to beſtow all my Letters in a ſecure Place, whether the Tranſcripts of thoſe I write to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> (for I always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Copy of the Original) or the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches</hi> I receive from thence.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Miniſter</hi> was afraid, leſt I might ſome Time or other be diſcover'd; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that my Chamber would be ſearch'd. Therefore obeying his Hint, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately carry'd all my <hi>Writings</hi> to <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> knowing his Houſe to be free from any Jealouſie of the <hi>State,</hi> and that the moſt Important Secrets in the World, might be there an <hi>Age</hi> unreveal'd.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Letters</hi> of my Writing, were enclos'd in One <hi>Box,</hi> and thoſe which I received from the <hi>Invincible Port,</hi> in Another. And this
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102962:79"/>was my Conſtant Cuſtom from that Time: As oft as I writ to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan,</hi> or had perus'd the <hi>Diſpatches</hi> which came from them, I diſpos'd of both in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Places, leaving all to the Care of <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, neither his Caution nor mine, were ſufficient to prevent the <hi>Reſolves</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> It was determin'd Above, That we ſhould loſe ſome of theſe Papers. <hi>Eliachim</hi> came to me to Day, before the <hi>Hour</hi> of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lanamiſi,</hi> all in Paſſion, aſtoniſh'd, raving and ſtaring like a Mad-Man. As ſoon as he enter'd my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he tore his Inner Veſt, which was of Crimſon Silk, fring'd round with Gold; and cry'd, <hi>We are undone, betray'd and ruin'd!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I preſently thought of my <hi>Writings;</hi> and ask'd him, Whether they were ſafe. In a Word, he told me he had loſt the <hi>Box,</hi> which contain'd the Letters ſent from the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port</hi> to me, and that his <hi>Slave</hi> a <hi>Negro,</hi> whom he kept in his Houſe, was miſſing. Thou mayſt imagine, Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that this News put me into no ſmall Confuſion. I preſently ſuſpected, that this Villain of a <hi>Negro,</hi> had got the <hi>Writings,</hi> and was gone to <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> with 'em: But then recollecting with Cooler Thoughts, That this <hi>African</hi> underſtood not <hi>Arabick,</hi> in which <hi>Language</hi> alone <hi>Eliachim</hi> and I us'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and, that conſequently, he never could know our Affairs, or read the <hi>Letters,</hi> which might tempt him to ſuch a <hi>Treaſon,</hi> I was at a Loſs what to think of it: Neither am I
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102962:80"/>better ſatisfy'd now, though I have ruminated on it theſe Twelve Hours. Onely I think, if <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> has theſe <hi>Papers</hi> in his Cuſtody, he would have given Orders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Time, to ſeize the ſuppoſed <hi>Titus</hi> of <hi>Moldavia.</hi> For, ſome of theſe <hi>Letters,</hi> take Notice of my having aſſumed that Name. But I cannot perceive any Attempt has been made in that Kind, or that any Body has been to enquire for me at my <hi>Lodging.</hi> For, I ſet <hi>Spies</hi> to obſerve, as ſoon as I departed thence with <hi>Eliachim,</hi> which was about Noon. We are now together in a Friend's Houſe, where we ſhall continue till we hear farther of this Event. As yet, we are in the Dark, and full of Fears: But Time, which brings all Things to Light, will convince us, what we have to Truſt to.</p>
                  <p>In the mean While, there is little News, ſave a Diſcourſe of a certain <hi>Convention</hi> at <hi>Norimbergh,</hi> and the Great <hi>Jubilee</hi> which is Celebrated at <hi>Rome;</hi> where, they ſay, the <hi>Chriſtians Chief Mufti,</hi> the Week before their <hi>Beiram,</hi> or <hi>Eaſter,</hi> waſh'd the Feet of Twelve <hi>Pilgrims;</hi> and that <hi>Cardinal Ludoviſio,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd Nine Thouſand of theſe <hi>Devotees</hi> at once, with a very Magnificent Feaſt. They ſay alſo, That the <hi>Pope</hi> will get this Year Two Millions of <hi>Sequins,</hi> by the Reſort of <hi>Pilgrims</hi> to that City.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s <hi>Reſident</hi> at this <hi>Court,</hi> has received a Letter, which Certifies him, that his <hi>Maſter</hi> has declar'd Prince <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> his Son, <hi>Succeſſor</hi> in the <hi>Throne.</hi>

                  <head>To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>BY the <hi>God</hi> whom I Adore, and by his <hi>Shadow,</hi> I ſwear, There is no Diſloyalty in <hi>Mahmut:</hi> Yet his Life is full of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Perils. The <hi>Box</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in my Laſt, is irrecoverably gone, and laid up in the Bowels of the Earth; if we may believe the Confeſſion of a Man, every Angle of whoſe Heart, has been ſearch'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Torments, even to Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliachim</hi>'s Slave, the <hi>Negro</hi> whom I ſpoke of, miſtook that <hi>Box,</hi> for one very like it, out of which he had often ſeen his <hi>Maſter</hi> take <hi>Jewels:</hi> For, this is the particular Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of that <hi>Jew.</hi> And the Weight of each was not ſo Unequal, as to rectifie his Error. Lucre tempted him, and the deſire of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whilſt the Darkneſs (for he committed this Villainy before Sun-riſing) and his own Guilty Fears, conſpir'd to baffle his intended Theft. The <hi>Boxes</hi> ſtood together (ſo Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was <hi>Eliachim</hi> of the <hi>Sublime Secrets,</hi> as not to venture 'em in a Place leſs ſecure, than that of his <hi>Jewels</hi>) and the Villain haſty to be gone, and confounded for want of Light, took up that wherein were the <hi>Writings,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his deſign'd Prey, the <hi>Jewels.</hi> He went directly into the Fields, purpoſing to bury this ſuppos'd Treaſure in the Earth,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102962:81"/>in ſome private Place, where he might take it forth at Diſcretion. But firſt opening the <hi>Box,</hi> to ſupply himſelf with ſuch <hi>Stones</hi> as he thought would be unqueſtionable Pawns for Money, to anſwer his preſent Neceſſities, that ſo he might the better provide for his Concealment; he was aſtoniſh'd, and his Heart became like Lead, when he found Nothing but Papers, full of Characters, to which he was wholly a Stranger. A Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Reſolutions preſented themſelves to him, in that Agony of his Mind, and he knew not which to fix on. Sometimes he thought to carry the <hi>Box</hi> back again as he found it; and ſince his Deſign had been thus ſtrangely baulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to Content himſelf till another Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. But then he conſider'd, 'twas too late to return before his <hi>Maſter</hi> would miſs both his <hi>Slave</hi> and <hi>Box;</hi> for the Sun was now far advanced in our Hemiſphere, and <hi>Eliachim</hi> is an early Riſer. In a Word, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it the ſafeſt Way, to bury it in the Ground, as he firſt intended had it been the <hi>Box</hi> of <hi>Jewels,</hi> and ſo ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Propoſing to himſelf this Advantage, in hiding the <hi>Papers</hi> in a ſecure Place, That if they were of Value, he might at any Time make Compoſition with his <hi>Maſter,</hi> by diſcovering where they were.</p>
                  <p>All that I have here related, is drawn from his own Mouth in the Midſt of Tortures. For <hi>Eliachim</hi> ſoon heard of his Fugitive <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro,</hi> who was ſeiz'd on the Rode to <hi>Lyons,</hi> by ſome Correſpondents of this <hi>Jew.</hi> Who
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102962:82"/>having Intelligence of it, took Horſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and went to the Place. He did not think it ſafe to make a publick Buſineſs of it, or to arraign him before the appointed <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Country;</hi> But relying on the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>Right</hi> of a <hi>Maſter,</hi> he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately put him to <hi>Tortures</hi> of divers Kinds, in a Houſe where he cou'd command any Thing.</p>
                  <p>The ſtout <hi>African,</hi> at firſt deny'd that he had medl'd with any <hi>Box;</hi> ſaying, he eſcap'd purely for the Sake of <hi>Liberty.</hi> But when a Succeſſion of divers <hi>Torments</hi> had quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown his Conſtancy, he confeſſed all that I have already related. <hi>Eliachim</hi> ſtill ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe, and that he only fram'd this as a plauſible Story to be freed from, or at leaſt to reſpite the Pains he ſuffered, caus'd ſharp Thorns to be thruſt under the Nails of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Toes; believing, that the Extremity of ſo ſenſible a Pain, wou'd extort the true Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from him. But he cou'd get Nothing elſe from the poor excruciated <hi>Negro,</hi> though now almoſt ready to expire, than that he had hid the <hi>Box</hi> under-Ground in a certain Corner of a Field, out of the City: To which he knew not how to direct <hi>Eliachim,</hi> but promis'd to ſhew it him, if he wou'd carry him alive to <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was no hard Task to perform, in the Opinion of the <hi>Jew;</hi> it being but a Days Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to this City, from the Place where they then were. But he was deceived in his Hopes; and now all the Applications and Cordials they cou'd uſe, came too late: For, that very Night, the <hi>Negro</hi> breath'd out his Soul.</p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:102962:82"/>
                  <p>However, when <hi>Eliachim</hi> came to <hi>Paris,</hi> he follow'd the Directions of his dead <hi>Slave</hi> as well as he cou'd, in ſearching every Corner of the Fields on that Side of the City, where this <hi>Black</hi> had been ſeen to go out. But all to no Purpoſe. He cou'd find nothing; nor have we any Hopes, ever to ſee that <hi>Box</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Yet I have many Qualms of Fear, leſt ſome Time or other it ſhould come to Light, to our Diſadvantage and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>I deſire thy Inſtructions, Sage <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Capital</hi> City, how I ſhall deport my ſelf, if it be my Lot to be diſcover'd. As to the Remaining <hi>Box,</hi> which has in it the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of my own <hi>Diſpatches,</hi> I have taken it Home to my Lodging. Believing it will be as ſafe here, as in the Houſe of <hi>Eliachim;</hi> ſince that faithful <hi>Jew,</hi> is no more exempted from Contingencies, than my ſelf: And I have no Servant to betray me.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Kingdom</hi> abounds at preſent, in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Rebellions. The <hi>French</hi> ſpare not to maſſacre one another, for the Sake of a Paſſion: While the <hi>Spaniards</hi> make their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of theſe Inteſtine Feuds. For, under Pretence of aſſiſting the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> they get Footing in <hi>Picardy,</hi> from whence it will not be eaſy to expel them. <hi>Leopold, Arch-Duke</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> is at the Head of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army; and has taken ſeveral Towns, belonging to the <hi>French King.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe People have been ever thirſty of Rule; and 'tis number'd among the Vertues of their <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> that they enlarg'd their <hi>Dominions</hi>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:102962:83"/>by the keen Edge of their Swords. But in all the <hi>Regiſters</hi> and <hi>Archives</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> it has not been found, that any of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion challeng'd a Right to Govern our <hi>Sultans,</hi> though during their Minority. It is ſufficient, That they ſhall have the Honour (according to the Ancient <hi>Capitulations</hi>) to ſucceed in the <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Oſman Princes,</hi> if ever that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Line</hi> ſhou'd be extinct: Which <hi>God</hi> avert, till the <hi>Final Conſummation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Wonder, they demanded not alſo his <hi>Royal</hi> Brothers, the other Sons of <hi>Sultan Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him;</hi> that ſo they might at one Blow, cut off the whole <hi>Oſman Race,</hi> and take <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Vacant Throne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have not heard any Thing theſe many <hi>Moons,</hi> what is become of thoſe <hi>High-born Infants;</hi> whether they are alive, or ſacrific'd to the Jealouſie of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> as has been the Cuſtom. Here are various flying Reports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. Some ſay, that thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd away <hi>Sultan Achmet,</hi> and that he is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately Educated in the Houſe of a certain <hi>Georgian.</hi> The <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of <hi>Mahomet</hi> be upon thee, and refreſh thy Heart, if thou haſt taken this Care to preſerve the <hi>Life</hi> of an <hi>Oſman Prince,</hi> which is more precious than a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand of <hi>Common Birth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Solyman</hi> and the Reſt of that Sublime <hi>Race,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> give 'em over for loſt; And I cannot contradict 'em, for Want of true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. Beſides, I have Reaſon to fear it is too true: In Regard it has been the cruel Practice of all, or moſt of our late <hi>Emperours,</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:102962:84"/>either to ſlaughter their Brethren as ſoon as they aſcend the <hi>Throne,</hi> or to put 'em to a more lingring Death and Martyrdom in a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true indeed, our preſent <hi>Sovereign</hi> is not yet arriv'd to thoſe Years, wherein Children commonly loſe their Native Innocence. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he ſuſpects none of his Brethren, nor harbours any unkind Thoughts againſt their Lives. Yet Cruelty may be inſinuated into his Tender Years, by the Artifices of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; eſpecially againſt thoſe of his Father's <hi>Blood,</hi> that did not alſo partake of hers. For <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> thou know'ſt, had Children by other Women, beſide the <hi>Sultana Valede.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Malteſes</hi> think they have one of theſe <hi>Royal</hi> Infants in their Poſſeſſion: Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the whole Story of thy <hi>Predeceſſor</hi>'s Voyage toward <hi>Egypt,</hi> with his Beautiful <hi>Slave</hi> and her Son, whom theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> honour as the <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> Thou art not Ignorant alſo, that this <hi>Infant</hi> with his <hi>Mother</hi> were Baniſh'd, out of Jealouſy, by the Order of <hi>Her</hi> who bore in her Womb <hi>Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> our Glorious <hi>Sovereign.</hi> The Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of which makes me tremble, for the Sake of the Young <hi>Princes,</hi> if there be any yet remaining alive. It is in thy Power to certify me, and in doing ſo thou wilt rid me of much Anxiety.</p>
                  <p>I am but a <hi>Slave</hi> of the <hi>Slaves</hi> who ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> and it is not decent for me to deſcant on the Actions of our moſt <hi>Abſolute Monarch,</hi> whoſe Will is not to be controul'd.

No leſs Inhuman was it of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the late <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> to guide the Hand of this our Preſent <hi>Sovereign,</hi> when but Six Years Old, and incapable of knowing what he did, to ſign a <hi>Warrant,</hi> for the <hi>Execution</hi> of his <hi>Father.</hi> Well may the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> call us <hi>Barbarians,</hi> when they contemplate the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> ſupported by ſuch <hi>

                  <p>NOtwithſtanding all my <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I have not Command enough of my Paſſion, to conceal it from thee, who haſt always been the Partaker of my Unequal Fortunes. What ever Magnanimity of Spirit I pretended to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in my Sickneſs, 'tis at preſent overcome by the Deſire of Eaſe. At that Time, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ſome <hi>Stoical</hi> Conſiderations made me induſtriouſly hide from thee the tormenting Pains I felt. I endeavoured to diſguize my Sufferings, and to paint my Miſery in ſuch Colours, that it could hardly be diſtinguiſhed from Happineſs. But now I have not Courage enough, to hide from thee my Fears and Apprehenſions: And all <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> are too little to hinder me, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the Uncertainty that we daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Human Affairs. This is a <hi>Theme</hi> ſo Popular, that were not my particular Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes very preſſing, 'twou'd make me ſick to ſay any Thing on a Subject, that has been in every Man's Mouth, ſince the Time that our <hi>Firſt Father</hi> appear'd among the <hi>Trees.</hi> Therefore thou may'ſt be aſſured, I am not going about to make a <hi>Declamation,</hi> or play the <hi>Orator;</hi> to expatiate and make large Deſcants, on the <hi>Inſtability</hi> of <hi>all Things.</hi> What I have to ſay, refers to my ſelf, and no body elſe,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102962:85"/>ſave to thoſe who are the Occaſion of my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneholy.</p>
                  <p>In the 10th. <hi>Moon</hi> of the laſt Year, I ſent a <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Kenan Baſſa,</hi> the New <hi>Haſnadar-Baſſy.</hi> I have a <hi>Copy</hi> of it by me, as I always retain of whatever <hi>Diſpatches</hi> I ſend to the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> whether to the <hi>Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> or my <hi>Private Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have perus'd this <hi>Letter</hi> ſeveral Times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe Eight and Forty Hours, and can find no juſt Ground of Offence, which that <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> cou'd take thereat: Unleſs he was angry with me, for deſiring him to be careful in tranſmitting my Money. As for the Reſt, I onely obey'd the particular Inſtructions, I received from <hi>Mahomet</hi> the late <hi>Vizir Azem:</hi> Who commanded me, not to ſpare the Greateſt <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> if I had reaſon either to counſel or reprehend him. For, ſaid he in his <hi>Letter, To this End art thou plac'd at ſuch a Diſtance, that beſides the Service thou doſt our</hi> Sovereign <hi>in diſcloſing the Secrets of the</hi> Infidels, <hi>thou mayſt alſo be free to write, whatever thou thinkeſt will conduce to his Intereſt, without ſtanding in Fear of the Revenge of the Grandees.</hi> Theſe were the very Words, of the <hi>Prime Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I only told him of ſome Miſcarriages in his <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> warning him to be wary in his <hi>Station.</hi> Either he was offended at this Freedom I took, or becauſe I preſum'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him how to order my <hi>Bills.</hi> Be it which it will. I have had a ſevere Reprimand from the <hi>Reis Effendi,</hi> whom I have the greateſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102962:86"/>Reaſon in the World, to eſteem my Friend.</p>
                  <p>It wou'd never have vex'd me, had he wrote plainly, and not diſguiſed his Sentiments. But all was obſcure, ſaving One blunt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which convinc'd me, That the real Ground of all this Anger, was my <hi>Letter</hi> to <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> wherein I deſir'd his Care as to my Money.</p>
                  <p>Can that <hi>Miniſter</hi> blame me, for being apprehenſive of Want in a Foreign Country, a <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Infidels,</hi> where I have no other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but with <hi>Courtiers</hi> and <hi>Strangers;</hi> where if I ſhould be in the leaſt ſuſpected, they wou'd preſently put me in Priſon, which wou'd hazard a Diſcovery of the <hi>Sublime Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets?</hi> Does he not know, That <hi>Money</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all Things; and that the Greateſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,</hi> obey the Power of <hi>Gold?</hi> It cannot be imagin'd, but that a Man in my <hi>Poſt,</hi> has a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand preſſing Occaſions for Money, which 'tis troubleſome to expreſs. And I have had very wrong Notions of my <hi>Employment,</hi> if I deſerve on this Account, to be reprov'd and threaten'd with ſuch Politick Circumlocutions: For, the <hi>Secretary</hi> charges me, with Unwillingneſs to continue in the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Ever Happy Port:</hi> As if he thought my Fidelity were corrupted, or that I had an Inclination to the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee, my <hi>Gnet, Perfidy</hi> I ever abhorr'd. This appears to me, the moſt terrible and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious of all Vices. I cou'd bear the Guilt and Reproach of a great many Crimes, which have leſs of Malice in their Conſtitution. I am not aſham'd of many Venial Frailties,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102962:86"/>which I daily commit, though the <hi>Law</hi> is ſevere againſt them. But, cou'd any Man accuſe me of Willful Treachery, and Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, I wou'd pray inſtantly, That the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> might be extinguiſh't, and that no <hi>Terrene Subſtance,</hi> might hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth have in it the leaſt <hi>Potential Light:</hi> That ſo I might neither be capable of ſeeing my ſelf, or of being expos'd to the Eyes of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And the better to eſcape the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which wou'd attend that Horrid Guilt, I would not only avoid Human Society, but if it were poſſible, I wou'd run away from my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>After all this, methinks ſuch a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per need not be ſuſpected, as averſe from the Intereſt, to which he has ſo ſolemnly ſworn.</p>
                  <p>I wou'd not have troubled thee with the News of any other Affliction; but, to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of what I never was Guilty of, and to be menac'd in dark Myſterious Terms, not by an Enemy, but by my Friend, and one who has in his Keeping the <hi>Immortal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of my <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Integrity;</hi> This cuts me to the Heart. And I had no other Way to eaſe my ſelf, but by venting my Anguiſh to thee.</p>
                  <p>If any of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> will charge me with Weakneſs, or want of Ability to act in this <hi>Station,</hi> I ſhould have no Reaſon to repine: Since none of them can think ſo meanly of <hi>Mahmut,</hi> as he does of himſelf. I boaſt of Nothing, but a Loyalty to my Truſt, incapable of being corrupted.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:102962:87"/>
                  <p>But I forget that I am a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> and therefore ought to be reſign'd to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> in all Things, without Complaint or Murmur. Beſides, I am infinitely oblig'd, in many Regards, to the <hi>Reis Effendi;</hi> and therefore, he may be allow'd to take his own Advantages. Perhaps his Reproofs may be Juſt, and 'tis my own Peeviſhneſs that hinders me from diſcerning it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I cou'd wiſh he wou'd henceforth expreſs his Reſentments with leſs Obſcurity, and not give me Grounds to apprehend the Loſs of his Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>For, where I once love, I hate a Changes. And if thou beeſt of the ſame Mind, We Two ſhall continue our <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> to the <hi>Other Side</hi> of the <hi>Grave.</hi>

Or, if thou owneſt the Title of a Friend, thou wilt claim a Right to reprove me. Be it how it will, Reproofs make the beſt Impreſſion, when they are given with Mildneſs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.

                  <p>But I tell thee, I will not blow up the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Fire, whoſe Flame is extinguiſh'd long ago, and whereof by this Time, I hope, there remains not the leaſt Smoak.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102962:88"/>have play'd the Incendiary: For I had both Matter enough, and Paſſion ſufficient, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate the already kindled Sparks. And, of this, I know thou art ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>Well! to make the beſt Conſtruction of it. The <hi>Haſnadarbaſſy</hi> was affronted, I believe, at the Freedom I took in adviſing him; not knowing that I had Poſitive Orders to do ſo, even to the <hi>Firſt Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> if I ſaw Occaſion. And to vent his Choler, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented the Buſineſs to thee, hoping by thy Means, to awe me into a fawning Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of my ſuppoſed Crime. If this was thy Intention in writing that ſharp Letter, I ſmile at his Miſtake; but am ſorry for thine, becauſe I eſteem thee my Friend. 'Twas but an Overſight in you both; and ſo let it paſs.</p>
                  <p>Thy Friendſhip I court, and refuſe not his, nor that of any <hi>Officer</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour all the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Port:</hi> I ſhew to every one the Reſpect that is due to his <hi>Quality:</hi> But I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write with Freedom to all, and not to ſpeak, as if I had the Bearded Head of a Barly-Stalk on my Tongue, which is apt to ſlip down a Man's Throat, and threatens to choak him that ſpeaks whilſt it is in his Mouth. This Charge I firſt receiv'd from the late <hi>Vizir Azem, Mahomet,</hi> and it has been ſince renew'd with freſh Inſtructions from others of <hi>Great Authority.</hi> They all tell me with much Aſſurance, That one chief End of my being plac'd here, is, that being
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102962:88"/>out of the Limits of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> yet holding a conſtant Intelligence, I may freely and without Fear, reprove the Vices and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Virtues of the Greateſt <hi>Governors</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> among the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> Nay, I am threat'ned with Puniſhment and the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Diſpleaſure, if I neglect any Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of this Nature, or appear Partial and Timorous in my Reprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>For, it ſeems, this is judged the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and effectual Method, to reform the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that are crept into Court, Camp, and City: Since every Man is oblig'd to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Letters which he receives from me: And they are all <hi>Regiſtred</hi> by thy Care: Whereby the <hi>Grandees</hi> are compell'd, either to live within the Limits of Juſtice, and their Duty, or elſe to be the Diſcoverers of their own Faults: Which will unavoidably bring them into Diſgrace, if not to the Loſs of their Liberty and Lives; or at leaſt put them to the Expence of coſtly Preſents, to make their Attonement. And, thou knoweſt, ſome Men would almoſt as willingly part with their Lives, as their Money, which is their <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all this, I hope thou wilt not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſed, if I perform my Duty. It is not for me to be frightned with Menaces, or ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Bribes. My Integrity is Proof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pride of the one, and Baſeneſs of the other. Yet I have a great Eſteem for the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer</hi> and thee, with other <hi>Miniſters</hi> who are my Friends. I could, to ſerve ſuch, freely hazard my Liberty, Fortune, and any Thing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102962:89"/>but my Honour, which I value at a far higher Rate than my Life.</p>
                  <p>Thou may'ſt <hi>Regiſter</hi> it for a Truth, That an <hi>Engliſh Embaſſador</hi> was in the 6th. <hi>Moon</hi> of this Year, murder'd by <hi>Villains</hi> in his Chamber at <hi>Madrid,</hi> the <hi>Capital</hi> City of <hi>Spain.</hi> There has been alſo a Great Battle fought in <hi>Scotland,</hi> between the Army of that <hi>Nation,</hi> who maintain their King's Intereſt, and the Forces of the New <hi>Engliſh Common-Wealth;</hi> wherein the Latter obtain'd a Signal Victory, having kill'd Three Thouſand on the Spot, taken Nine Thouſand Priſoners, Fifteen Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arms, Two Hundred Enſigns, and all their Cannon and Baggage. Theſe are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous Beginnings of that <hi>Republick,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound much to the Honour of the <hi>Engliſh General, Oliver,</hi> whom every Body extols for a Gallant Man.

                  <p>THeſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> of whom I ſpake to thee in my laſt, are a ſtrange Sort of People in their Manner of Life. But we muſt not cenſure 'em, becauſe we are of Kin. I ſpeak not of my ſelf: For, though I am an <hi>Arab,</hi> yet the greateſt part of thoſe who ſerve in the Armies of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> are deſcended from the <hi>Crims.</hi> I mean, the <hi>Spahi's</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariots.</hi> Thou know'ſt the <hi>Originals</hi> of theſe <hi>Military Orders,</hi> and that they are more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> who being <hi>Strangers</hi> by <hi>Blood,</hi> are brought up to the <hi>Lure</hi> of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> They know neither Father nor Mother, (I ſpeak of the <hi>Tributary</hi> Youths) nor have they any Partial Fondneſs for their <hi>Native</hi> Country. They are Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a perfect Reſignation to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> and his <hi>Chief Miniſters:</hi> Yet often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey both, and not ſeldom put 'em in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their Lives. How many <hi>Vizirs,</hi> have been ſacrificed to a cunning <hi>Janizar-Aga;</hi> who to prevent his own Ruine, has tempted thoſe under his Command to Mutiny, and accept of no Attonement for their pretended Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102962:90"/>leſs than the Life of the <hi>Firſt Deputy.</hi> The Rigid <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>Sultan Oſman,</hi> Uncle to our preſent <hi>Sovereign,</hi> will not be forgot by thoſe who love the <hi>Ottoman Family</hi> better than theſe <hi>Baſtard-Hectors.</hi> Shall the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>True Believers,</hi> be ruin'd by <hi>Renegades?</hi> Beſides, their <hi>Diſcipline</hi> is extreamly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; they marry, and follow <hi>Mechanick</hi> Trades, repugnant to the Auſtere Manners of the <hi>Primitive Guards,</hi> who were wholly attentive to <hi>Martial</hi> Exerciſes.</p>
                  <p>Were this to come to the Hands of a <hi>Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zary,</hi> he would curſe me to the <hi>Pains</hi> which have neither <hi>Medium</hi> nor <hi>End.</hi> Yet I had once a Friend of that <hi>Order, Caſſim Hali,</hi> the <hi>Chief Aga,</hi> a brave Man, and of the ſame Sentiments as my ſelf. He ſought to reform that Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly <hi>Militia,</hi> but was oppos'd by the Wiſe Men in Power. He wou'd freely have ſacrific'd his own Grandeur and Intereſt, for the Good of the <hi>Muſſulman Empire;</hi> but was over-aw'd by thoſe, who had no other Intereſt, but in its Ruine.</p>
                  <p>Thou know'ſt who I mean; Neither am I a Stranger to the Heroick Bravery of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Solyman,</hi> when he bearded the <hi>Boſtangi A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> on that Account. That <hi>Gardiner</hi> was of the <hi>Faction,</hi> being the Son of a <hi>Janizany,</hi> and train'd up in all the Practices of the <hi>Seditious.</hi> It makes me aſham'd, when I hear the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> upbraid the <hi>Wiſeſt</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Monarch</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> with Folly, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this Inſolent and Mutinous <hi>Soldiery,</hi> to continue in the <hi>Empire.</hi> And I tremble
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102962:90"/>to think, That one Time or other, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> of <hi>Ertogriel,</hi> will owe its Ruine and <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> to theſe Diſloyal <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> whom it cheriſhes in the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much more aſſur'd is the <hi>French</hi> King, of his <hi>Guard</hi> of <hi>Switzers;</hi> whoſe Fidelity was never ſtain'd, with the leaſt Infamous Brand of Perfidiouſneſs, in taking up Arms againſt their <hi>Maſter,</hi> whoſe Bread they eat. Theſe are Mercenary Soldiers, who travel out of their <hi>Native</hi> Country, to ſerve <hi>Foreign</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and will ſhed the laſt drop of their Blood, rather than betray their Truſt. Therefore they are admitted into the <hi>Palaces,</hi> and nigh the Bed Chambers of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> with full Confidence of their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Integrity.</p>
                  <p>As for their <hi>Country,</hi> it is barren and poor, conſiſting chiefly of Rocks and Deſarts: Which occaſions the Youth, who are generally very ſtrong and hardy, to ſeek their Subſiſtence A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, by ſerving in the <hi>Guards</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> of Neighbouring <hi>Monarchs</hi> and <hi>States.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Regiments of the <hi>Switzers,</hi> now ſerve in the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> under the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are Veſſels arriv'd lately in ſome of the <hi>French</hi> Harbours, which bring News of the Ill Succeſs of our Arms in the <hi>Siege</hi> of <hi>Candia,</hi> the Chief City of that <hi>Iſland.</hi> They talk, as if above Two Thouſand <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> were blown up in the Ninth <hi>Moon;</hi> and that <hi>Chuſaein Baſſa,</hi> diſcourag'd by this Loſs, and with the Inconveniencies of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102962:91"/>
                     <hi>Winter,</hi> was forc'd to raiſe the <hi>Siege,</hi> in the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>October.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> magnify the Valour of the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Malta,</hi> who ſignaliz'd themſelves by many brave Actions, during this <hi>Siege.</hi> And if all be true, that is related of theſe <hi>Chriſtian Champions,</hi> we cannot in common Juſtice deny 'em their due Character, and number ſome of them at leaſt among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Otherwiſe, we ſhou'd come ſhort of theſe <hi>Weſtern Nazarenes</hi> in <hi>Generoſity,</hi> who with no leſs honourable Expreſſions, extol the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Courage, and Invincible Conſtancy of the Illuſtrious <hi>Chuſaein,</hi> and the Alacrity of all the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Soldiers, in the Service of our <hi>Great Maſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet they cannot forbear reflecting on the Cowardiſe of the <hi>Janizaries;</hi> who after that fatal Blow, had they ſtoutly maintain'd their other Poſts, that brave <hi>Baſſa</hi> wou'd not ſo ſoon have quitted the <hi>Siege</hi> of this <hi>Important Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for other News, I have little to acquaint thee with, ſave a ſeeming Calm at preſent in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which has for the greateſt Part of the Year, been harraſs'd with <hi>Civil Diſcords</hi> and Slaughters. <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Chief City which held out againſt the King, is now reduc'd to Obedience, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd <hi>Monarch</hi> retir'd, and an Appearance of <hi>Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sueden,</hi> we hear, was ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Crown'd</hi> in the Tenth <hi>Moon</hi> of the laſt

                  </p>

                  <p>IN the Name of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophet,</hi> what Occaſion hadſt thou to ſend me ſuch an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Letter?

Doſt thou think to frighten <hi>Mahmut</hi> into a ſordid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with thy Ambition, whom Nothing can terrify, ſo long as he preſerves himſelf free from any Stain of Diſloyalty? I tell thee,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102962:92"/>I'm another <hi>Achilles,</hi> Invulnerable all over, ſave the <hi>Soles</hi> of my <hi>Feet,</hi> which are the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems</hi> of our moſt tender <hi>Affections.</hi> There thou may'ſt wound me, with the ſoft Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of pretended Friendſhip. But if once thou appeareſt, with the Naked Face of an Enemy, I'm preſently on my Guard.</p>
                  <p>Thou accuſeſt me of many Crimes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I was never Guilty; loadeſt me with a Thouſand undeſerved Reproaches, and all to vent thy Choler: Threatning me with Revenge, becauſe I once excus'd the Lateneſs of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to <hi>Minezim Aluph Baſſa,</hi> then newly Veſted by our Munificent <hi>Sultan,</hi> by laying the Blame on the Badneſs of the Ways, or the Inſolence of Soldiers by whom the <hi>Poſts</hi> are often intercepted in Time of <hi>War:</hi> or, in Fine, on thy Neglect in not ſupplying me with more early Intelligence. Wherein 'tis eaſie to diſcern, That thou wert the laſt I wou'd accuſe to that <hi>Miniſter,</hi> though thou wert Principally in the Fault. For I was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards inform'd, That the <hi>Poſts</hi> were neither retarded by any <hi>Impaſſable</hi> Roads, or ſtopp'd by the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Military</hi> Men, but arriv'd here at their accuſtom'd Seaſons. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou haſt no Reaſon to be offended at me, unleſs it be for the Shortneſs of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and that it was defective in Malice.</p>
                  <p>Thou wouldſt take it ill, if in my own Defence I ſhou'd complain to the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> of thy frequent Neglects in this Kind. But I ſcorn to vindicate my ſelf, at the Price of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's Diſgrace and Peril. Onely I
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102962:92"/>adviſe thee, to forbear threatning. It is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on thy Prudence, to menace a Man who has no other Reſentments of thy Paſſion, than to own himſelf oblig'd to thee, for ſo open a Diſcovery of it. Woud'ſt have the very Spleen of my Humour? I ſmile at thee. Thou haſt made me as Jocund as <hi>Democritus.</hi> If thou know'ſt not who I mean; He was a pleaſant ſort of a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> to whom all Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Actions, were Objects of Mirth. There was another Whining <hi>Sage,</hi> that perpetually Wept. The moſt Comical Paſſages, and ſuch as mov'd all Men to Laughter, drew Floods of Tears from his Eyes. His Name was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus.</hi> It is hard to determine, which of theſe Two was in the Right. But I think I am not much in the Wrong, to be a little pleaſant with thee. Perhaps, it may put thee into a better Humour. However, I wou'd not have thee be diſpleas'd with thy ſelf, for being of ſo peeviſh a Diſpoſition. 'Tis obſerv'd, That Paſſionate Men are always beſt Natur'd, and free from ſecret Malice. <hi>Choler</hi> is as neceſſary as our <hi>Blood.</hi> Without the <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> we cou'd not live; and if we were void of the <hi>Former,</hi> our <hi>Lives</hi> wou'd be as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> as that of <hi>Snails</hi> and <hi>Oyſters.</hi> We ſhou'd be abſolute <hi>Drones.</hi>

Day of this <hi>Moon,</hi> and arriv'd in this City on the 16th, which was Yeſterday, attended by a numerous <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> conſiſting of ſome <hi>Princes,</hi> divers of the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> and one wou'd think, of <hi>Half</hi> the <hi>Citizens</hi> of <hi>Paris.</hi> Even thoſe who triumph'd laſt Year, and made Bonfires for their Confinement; Yeſterday throng'd out of the City, to welcome them Home with Acclamations of Joy, and to congratulate their Releaſe. So fickle and inconſtant a Thing is the <hi>Multitude,</hi> driven hither and thither, with every Artificial Declaration of <hi>Stateſmen</hi> or Pretence of <hi>Faction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there were divers <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> who from the Firſt Hour of their being ſeiz'd, reſolv'd not to leave a Stone unturn'd, to procure their Freedom. The <hi>Grandees</hi> that were their Friends, retir'd to their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> and rais'd <hi>Rebellions</hi> in the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> All the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was haraſs'd with <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars.</hi> The <hi>Parliaments</hi> decreed againſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102962:94"/>the <hi>Court:</hi> And there wanted not Cabals of Seditious <hi>Courtiers,</hi> even in the <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> to undermine the <hi>Royal</hi> Authority; which the <hi>Cardinal Miniſter</hi> thought to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, by the Impriſonment of the <hi>Princes.</hi> In all Places, the <hi>King</hi>'s Intereſt ran Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not wonder at this when thou ſhalt know, that the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are not <hi>Slaves</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> like the <hi>Baſſa's</hi> of the moſt Serene <hi>Empire,</hi> who owe all their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the ſole Favour of our Munificent <hi>Sultans.</hi> Theſe <hi>Princes,</hi> enjoy all that and more by Inheritance, which our <hi>Grandees</hi> acquire only by their Merits, and the Smiles of their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> Hence it is, that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt is rivetted in the Hearts of the People, who revere the <hi>Blood Royal,</hi> in whatſoever Channels it runs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thinking Men blame the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi>'s Conduct in this Affair; ſaying, There was neither <hi>Juſtice</hi> nor <hi>Policy</hi> in it. Indeed, if a Mans Wit is to be meaſur'd by the Succeſs of his Contrivances, the Cenſure of theſe People is true. For the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſeems to have made a Trap for himſelf.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he perceived the <hi>King</hi> was prevail'd on by the Importunity of his Uncle, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to releaſe the <hi>Princes,</hi> and that they had at the ſame Time earneſtly begg'd of him, that this <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> might be remov'd from the <hi>Court;</hi> he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly pack'd up his Moveables, and with-drew privately towards the Place, where the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:102962:94"/>were Confin'd: Hoping, that though he had loſt his Firſt Point, yet he might make an indifferent After-Game, by going in Perſon to the <hi>Royal Priſoners,</hi> and aſſuring them, 'twas to him they ow'd their Releaſe; ſince it was in his Power to carry 'em away with him, as alſo thoſe who brought 'em the King's <hi>Mandate.</hi> For, he travell'd not without a conſiderable <hi>Guard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis ſaid, the <hi>Princes</hi> receiv'd him with ſeeming Compliments and Addreſſes of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility; promiſing their Friendſhip to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> now a <hi>Voluntary Exile,</hi> and in a worſe Condition than themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is very ſtrange that ſo great a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who Inherited all that <hi>Abſolute Power,</hi> which his <hi>Predeceſſor Richlieu</hi> had at this <hi>Court,</hi> ſhould thus on a ſudden abandon his Fortune. But it is thought, he is not gone to pick Straws.</p>
                  <p>However, he has by this timely Flight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the Diſpleaſure of ſeeing himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to depart by an <hi>Arreſt</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which was publiſh'd within Two Days after he was gone; commanding him to depart the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> within Fifteen Days.</p>
                  <p>The Wiſe <hi>Miniſter,</hi> foreſaw this Diſgrace approaching, and therefore thought it more becoming his Honour, to depart of his own Accord: Having ſtill the Advantage, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the <hi>State</hi> with Ingratitude, in that they have reduced to ſuch Streights, the Man by whoſe Auſpicious Conduct, <hi>France</hi> had been elevated to an Extraordinary <hi>Grandeur</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>I Am glad to hear thou art alive. Thy Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came in a good Hour; for I bear a true Affection to thoſe of my <hi>Blood,</hi> and have been particularly anxious for thee theſe many Years.

                  <p>Thou haſt ſent me a large and ſatisfactory Account of thy <hi>Obſervations</hi> in <hi>Aſia:</hi> Yet I am ſorry, thou hadſt not Time to penetrate into the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Indian Bramins.</hi> I am more ambitious, to pry into the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> of thoſe <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> than into any other <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.

                  </p>
                  <p>I have convers'd with ſeveral <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and others, who have been in the <hi>Indies;</hi> but they ſeem to relate all Things Partially, out of a <hi>Natural</hi> Averſion for the <hi>Manners</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> And I knew not how to diſprove 'em, till my Brother <hi>Peſtelihali</hi> undeceived me.

Thy <hi>Journal,</hi> touches but lightly the <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, not

                  </p>
                  <p>I depend much on thy Promiſe of ſending me a <hi>Journal</hi> of thy <hi>Travels</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi> To that <hi>Quarter</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> I am much a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; not having met with any Authentick Relation, of the <hi>Regions</hi> in the <hi>South.</hi>

                     <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> tell Wonderful Things of theſe <hi>Parts.

                  <p>I do not repreſent this to thee as a Truth, though related by that Learn'd <hi>Grecian.</hi> Thou mayſt repute it for a <hi>Fable,</hi> as I do. But let this Paſſage be a Hint, that I expect from thee none but Solid Remarks.</p>
                  <p>It wou'd pleaſe me to be aſſur'd of one Thing, which perhaps thou haſt heard of when thou waſt in <hi>Barbary.</hi> Very credible <hi>Authors</hi> report, that when the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and driven into this Corner of <hi>Africk,</hi> they ſet up <hi>Two Pillars</hi> of <hi>Marble,</hi> whereon they Engrav'd theſe <hi>Words,</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:102962:96"/>as a <hi>Laſting Monument</hi> of their Expulſion, <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Invention</hi> of <hi>Ships,</hi> is by ſome aſcrib'd to theſe <hi>People,</hi> whom Neceſſity taught to ſeek Reſt on the Unquiet <hi>Ocean;</hi> ſince the more Turbulent Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> wou'd not permit them to enjoy any Repoſe on the <hi>Land,</hi> having haraſs'd 'em from one Place to another, till at length they drove 'em to the very <hi>Borders</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> But, thou know'ſt, the <hi>Chineſes</hi> pretend to the <hi>

But I reprehended my Kinſman's Folly in one Letter; and his Anſwer, though late, convinc'd me, That he was not guilty of Malice, ſo much as of Raſhneſs and Credulity. I was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblig'd to the <hi>Kaimacham,</hi> for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102962:99"/>and Friendſhip in this Affair. The good old <hi>Miniſter</hi> had a real Kindneſs for me, and took no ſmall Pains to penetrate into the Cauſes of my <hi>Couſin</hi>'s eager Paſſion, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice againſt me. At length he found it to be only the Practices of <hi>Ikingi,</hi> who took Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Temper, equally Loyal and Flexible; inſinuated into his Youthful Mind, Monſtrous <hi>Idea's</hi> of me; and, in fine, ſet him a railing at me with a fierce kind of Liberty, wherever he came. The wiſe <hi>Baſſa</hi> ſoon open'd my Kinſman's Eyes; brought him to his Senſe; and the Iſſue of all was, that <hi>Solyman</hi> writ me a Letter of Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</p>
                  <p>But ſince this, the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Pages</hi> has laid new Trains for me, and drawn a great many more to his Party. He has corrupted <hi>Muſtapha Guir,</hi> an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and <hi>Page</hi> to the <hi>Old Queen;</hi> with whom I once held a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and, as I thought, had contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a Familiarity and Friendſhip. But, it ſeems, it was only an Appearance, without Reality. I could give thee a long Liſt of thoſe, whom this <hi>Academick</hi> has taught to ſlander <hi>Mahmut:</hi> But I will not appear ſo Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Beſides, this is not the only Grievance of which I complain.</p>
                  <p>Shall I remonſtrate to thee, moſt Excellent and Serene <hi>Baſſa,</hi> the true Cauſe of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs? I am weary of living among <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</hi> Favour me with thy Aſſiſtance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, that I may have leave to retire from this Place, and vindicate my ſelf before the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102962:99"/>Faces of my Enemies. And having had that Honour, rend'ring alſo a juſt Account of the Affairs wherewith I am entruſted, I may viſit my <hi>Native Country,</hi> and ſpend the Reſidue of my Days in <hi>Arabia,</hi> the <hi>Scene</hi> of all our <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Great Actions; the Place where I firſt drew my Breath. I languiſh for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romatick Air of <hi>Admoim,</hi> the Cryſtal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Cooler Shades of that Happy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</hi> I long to ſee the Groves which encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the <hi>Village</hi> of my <hi>Nativity,</hi> the Turrets of thy Father's Houſe, and the <hi>Moſque</hi> of <hi>Haſen</hi> the <hi>Prophet.</hi> For, tho' I took no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of theſe Things in my Infancy; yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once ſeen 'em in my Riper Years, when I were able to make more laſting Reflections, I ſhall never forget theſe delightful Objects, ſo long as I live.</p>
                  <p>If this be an Infirmity, pardon it, Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Arab,</hi> ſince it is Natural to all Men. Thou thy ſelf, haſt enjoy'd the Pleaſure of reviſiting that ſweet <hi>Region:</hi> Pity <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut,</hi> who burns with Deſire to taſte the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Or, if this ſhall be thought too great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, to the poor <hi>Exil'd Mahmut;</hi> yet it will be eaſy for thee, who art a Favourite, to obtain of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that I may at leaſt be recall'd from this <hi>Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſome body elſe ſubſtituted in my Place.

                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:102962:100"/>for this Obſcure, yet Hazardous Poſt. 'Tis Pity but ſuch a Man's Thirſt of Perils, ſhould be gratify'd.</p>

                  <p>I hear that <hi>Chuſaein Baſſa,</hi> is made <hi>Vizir Azem.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> have a very great Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Valour.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102962:101"/>Regularity, and Conſtant Returns.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>below,</hi> there is an Univerſal <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration</hi> and <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> of <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Things:</hi> A Perpetual Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of Human Events.

                  <p>I was born in the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Sultan Achmet,</hi> from whom our preſent <hi>Sovereign</hi> is the Sixth <hi>Emperour,</hi> that has aſcended the Glorious <hi>Throne</hi> of the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> May <hi>God</hi> grant him a Long Life, and a <hi>Series</hi> of Years bleſs'd with Continual Health, and Victory over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I pray <hi>Heaven</hi> alſo, to perpetuate thy New <hi>Office,</hi> to the laſt Period of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Life; and in wiſhing this, I ſay all that can be expected.</p>
                  <p>But when I reflect on the frequent and bloody <hi>Tragedies,</hi> that have been acted in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> ſince I can remember, and the many <hi>Sacrifices</hi> that have been made of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's, Vizir's, Baſſa's,</hi> and <hi>Principal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> beſides the Maſſacres and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries of Meaner Perſons; It makes me me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, amidſt the Joys I conceive for thy late <hi>Exaltation;</hi> and fills me with Fears, leſt my good Wiſhes to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> and Thee, who art his Right Hand, ſhou'd by

                  <p>The Death of the Old <hi>Queen</hi> (the News of which is lately arriv'd at this <hi>Court</hi>) does but revive and encreaſe my Apprehenſion, of Greater <hi>Tragedies</hi> to come: Becauſe one Act of Cruelty, ſtill propagates another. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is Prolifick, and Miſchief is never at a Stand. 'Tis true indeed, as it is not decent to inſult o'er the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of <hi>Illuſtrious Perſons;</hi> ſo neither has a Loyal <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> any great Reaſon to mourn for the Fall of a Woman, by whoſe Connivance her <hi>Royal</hi> Son, and our late <hi>Great Maſter, Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> fell a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to the <hi>Mufti</hi>'s Indignation. 'Twas an Unnatural Part in a <hi>Mother:</hi> And we may ſay, the <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> has overtaken her, in making her <hi>Grandſon</hi> ſign the <hi>Warrant</hi> for her <hi>Death,</hi> with the <hi>Conſent</hi> of that very <hi>Mufti,</hi> at whoſe <hi>Inſtigation</hi> ſhe had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Murder of his <hi>Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet after all, may not ſhe have left behind her a Party in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> or at leaſt in the <hi>State,</hi> who will ſtudy to revenge her Fall; or, however, do ſome Miſchief to prevent their own? Let me not ſeem to contradict my own Arguments; and whilſt I plead againſt Revenge and Cruelty, appear an <hi>Advocate</hi> for thoſe Inhuman Paſſions. I do not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſurviving <hi>Creatures</hi> of this Unhappy <hi>Queen,</hi> to excite in thee, falſe Sentiments of Juſtice, ſuſpicious <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of a poſſible <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy,</hi> and ſo ſtimulate thee to puniſh them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102962:102"/>by Anticipation, for Crimes of which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they never will be Guilty. I rather ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt theſe Things, that after ſo many <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> in the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> a Stop may be now put to future Miſchiefs; leſt, whilſt Men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a particular and ſelf-Intereſs'd Revenge, the Contagion ſhou'd ſpread, and <hi>Cruelty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Univerſal, and Infinite.</p>
                  <p>Let it ſuffice, that no leſs than Three of our <hi>Sultans,</hi> have been Depos'd and Strangl'd within theſe Thirty Years: Not to mention the <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>Royal</hi> Blood, that has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd the Private Chambers of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the Priſons of the <hi>Ottoman Princes</hi> Brothers, or Sons to the <hi>Emperours</hi> formerly Reigning.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were Barbarous Cures of untimely Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies; and it is Pity that ſuch Royal Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, ſhou'd ever be repeated again. Why ſhou'd the <hi>Poſterity</hi> of <hi>Ottoman,</hi> be in this Regard the only <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfortunate Princes</hi> on Earth? Were it not much more Noble, and equally Wiſe, to take the Meaſures of <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> Policy, where, to prevent Sedition and Diſcords about <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> are confin'd indeed, but to a very Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Liberty: Whilſt they have Palaces, Parks, and Large Fields at Command; are ſerv'd by a <hi>Princely</hi> Train, and deny'd no Lawful Pleaſures, within the <hi>Pale</hi> of their <hi>Reſtraint:</hi> For there is an exceeding high Mountain in the Country, the Top of which is very Spacious, containing large Tracts of <hi>Ground,</hi> many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Seraglio's,</hi> furniſh'd with whatſoever can contribute to the Enjoyment of theſe <hi>Princes,</hi> or
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102962:102"/>at leaſt to compenſate for their Want of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Liberty. This Mountain, is environ'd with a high and ſtrong Wall, having but one En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and that guarded by Soldiers; ſo that no Man can go in or out, who has not the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Warrant, or at leaſt a Permiſſion from the <hi>Prime Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State:</hi> For he, upon the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Emperor,</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls a <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Officers,</hi> who from among theſe Impriſon'd <hi>Princes,</hi> chuſe him whom they think moſt worthy to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. The reſt, who never felt the Appetite to <hi>Reign</hi> (for they are carry'd to this Place in their Infancy, and kept in perpetual Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>State-Affairs</hi>) paſs away their Time without Envy, or repining at the Exaltation of their Brother. Addicting themſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Innocent Delights of that Rural Life, or to the Study of <hi>Books,</hi> whereof they have great Plenty in their <hi>Libraries,</hi> and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together treating of Matters of Divine or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Speculation. Whereby, though they know nothing of <hi>State-Artifices,</hi> and <hi>Intrigues</hi> of <hi>Courts,</hi> yet they become able <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and vers'd in all the <hi>Liberal Sciences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wou'd to <hi>God</hi> our <hi>Ottoman Princes</hi> (I mean the Younger Brothers) had but half this Liberty granted them. Then the <hi>Infidels</hi> wou'd have no reaſon to call the <hi>Exalted Port,</hi> a <hi>Neſt</hi> of <hi>Vulturs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt not find Fault with the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> though they tend to the Scandal and Ruine of the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The chief Diſcourſe at preſent is, about a Marriage lately ſolemniz'd between the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua.</hi> She is his Third Wife ſucceſſively; for <hi>Polygamy</hi> is not allow'd, even to the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,</hi> in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> where the <hi>Prieſts</hi> bear all the Sway.</p>

                  <p>I will not trouble thee with the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which would take up a <hi>Volume.</hi> But in ſhort, it appears, that notwithſtanding all the ſtrict Proviſion that was, or could be made; this great <hi>Eſtate,</hi> after it had remain'd Sixty Years <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited,</hi> was at Length <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> between Two <hi>Princes,</hi> both claiming an Equal Right to the <hi>Whole;</hi> Yet to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Wars, and Effuſion of Blood, each was contented with <hi>Half.</hi> Theſe were <hi>Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang,</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:102962:104"/>Duke of <hi>Newburgh;</hi> and <hi>Erneſt, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> In whoſe <hi>Families,</hi> the Parted <hi>Succeſſion</hi> has continued to this Day.</p>
                  <p>The Occaſion of the preſent Quarrel, is their <hi>Difference</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> being a <hi>Catholick,</hi> and he of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh</hi> a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> It ſeems, the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghers</hi> had formerly made Inrodes on thoſe of <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Juliers,</hi> carrying away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Derviſes</hi> from their <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Convents,</hi> and detaining them in Servitude, for many Years, contrary to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Articles</hi> that had been drawn up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em. They alſo uſed them with great Cruelty, and committed a Thouſand Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the <hi>Roman Imaums,</hi> wherever they got 'em in their Power.</p>
                  <p>Thus their Affairs continu'd, till the late <hi>Agreement</hi> at <hi>Munſter.</hi> Since which Time, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Newburgh</hi> endeavoured to free his <hi>Subjects</hi> from their former Calamities, and reſtore things to their Ancient State.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> making this an Occaſion of <hi>War,</hi> has now invaded the <hi>Dominions</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Duke.</hi> He is not gone in Perſon, but has ſent a good Soldier, whom they call <hi>Otho Sparr,</hi> with Four Thouſand Men to begin the Campaign; who, 'tis ſaid, will be follow'd by a greater Army.</p>
                  <p>But before he took the Field, the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> had an <hi>Interview</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> with the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> about this Affair, who is alſo a <hi>Proteſtant:</hi> So that 'tis
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102962:105"/>thought, no ſmall Diſturbance will ariſe in the <hi>Empire.</hi> All Joy and Peace to <hi>True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> has caus'd a <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to be ſpread abroad full of Specious Pretences, that ſo his Conqueſts may be the more eaſy. He talks of nothing, but reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Juliers</hi> and <hi>Mons</hi> to their Ancient Liberties and Rights, both in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> Matters; promiſing the faireſt Things in the World, to thoſe that obey him, and receive his Armies with Friendſhip: On the other ſide, threatning to treat thoſe who reſiſt him, with the utmoſt Severity that is due to Traytors and Rebels. And all this, for the Sake of Two or Three Inſignificant <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> wherein they differ; mere Trifles, Litteral Whimſies, the Sport of their <hi>Doctors,</hi> the Spawn of Wanton and Luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Brains. For, no greater was the <hi>Original</hi> Difference between the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. <hi>One</hi> will be ſav'd by the Strength of his <hi>Phancy,</hi> which he calls <hi>Faith,</hi> without doing any <hi>Good Work</hi> toward it: The <hi>Other</hi> toils all his Life-Time to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>Heaven,</hi> and thinks he can never do enough to obtain his End. He wears out the Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Churches,</hi> and makes the Skin of his Knees like that of a <hi>Camel,</hi> with perpetual Kneeling, and Praying to <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures.</hi> And after all, they may be both <hi>damn'd,</hi> for ought I know, for their Ill Lives. They tear and devour one another like Wild Beaſts, and think to gain <hi>Paradiſe</hi> by their Unnatural Zeal.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Uſeph Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>SUſpect me not: I have an equal Eſteem for thee, as I have for the other <hi>Baſſa's</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divan.</hi> But I find it difficult to pleaſe any. They are Captious, and every one wou'd have all my Letters addreſſ'd to himſelf: As if I were plac'd here to ſerve <hi>Particular</hi> Intereſts, and not the <hi>Publick.</hi> However, I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the tacit Honour they do me, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo covetous of poor <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence. I wiſh I were in a Condition to be more Partial: Then I would quickly make thee and ſome others ſenſible, which are the Perſons, for whom I have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Regard.</p>
                  <p>But as the Caſe is at preſent, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> I have receiv'd; and, by Turns, write to All.</p>
                  <p>Wherein, if I fail of <hi>Arithmetical Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> I will make Amends by the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Geometry:</hi> If I write but ſeldom to ſome, I deſire that the Length of my Letters, and Solidity of the Matter, may be accepted as a proper Supplement.</p>
                  <p>But, thou haſt no Reaſon to complain on this Score, unleſs it be of thy ſelf, for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling into <hi>Remote Countries,</hi> whither I knew not how to follow thee with Letters, or any
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102962:106"/>other Way. Beſides, the former Friendſhip that has been between us, is a ſufficient Counterſcarp againſt all Suſpicion of Neglect on my Part, who am a Thouſand Times obliged to thee for ſo many repeated Favours. For the ſake of <hi>God</hi> therefore, and <hi>All</hi> that is <hi>Good,</hi> wound my Heart no more with theſe Undeſerv'd Reproaches: But believe ſtedfaſtly, That <hi>Mahmut</hi> can never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and falſe.</p>
                  <p>Thy Letter is a Miſcellany, of Friendly Complaints and Compliments. Thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me a Character, to which I do not pretend. 'Tis true, indeed, and I thank <hi>God</hi> and my <hi>Good Stars</hi> for it, that I was not born Blind, Deaf, or Dumb. <hi>Nature</hi> gave me my <hi>Senſes</hi> free from any Manifeſt Defect; and I have an Indifferent good <hi>Memory.</hi> When I was Young, I had an Inclination to read <hi>Books;</hi> and Fortune has ſince fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd me, with many Opportunities for that Purpoſe. But I found the moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Study</hi> to be, that of <hi>MY SELF,</hi> to which all the Laborious Pains of the <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Academies,</hi> ſerve only as a certain Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Diſcipline. Nay, without theſe, a Man may attain all the Knowledge that is Neceſſary to the Accompliſhment of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For ſo did the Firſt <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Letters</hi> were extant. If thou wilt be perfectly Wiſe, read the <hi>ALCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAN,</hi> and the <hi>

                     <hi>Each;</hi> but moſt of all, in the <hi>Laſt:</hi> For, <hi>Man</hi> is a <hi>Medley</hi> of <hi>all Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Were this Leſſon well learn'd and practis'd in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> there wou'd not be ſo many little Quarrels among theſe <hi>Infidels;</hi> or at leaſt, ſuch <hi>Petty Originals,</hi> wou'd not produce ſo many <hi>Fatal Conſequences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the firſt Time the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> with his Brothers, were releas'd from their <hi>Impriſonment</hi> (whereof I have given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to <hi>Minezim Aluph</hi>) there appear'd much Coldneſs in the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Reception of 'em, and their Addreſſes to her. On both ſides they were at a Loſs, how to behave themſelves: For, all their Civilities were forc'd. 'Tis true, there was a Splendid Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage of Reconciliation; but it ſoon vaniſh'd. Their ſuppreſs'd Paſſions, diſcover'd themſelves by Degrees, and at length broke out into open Enmity.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> appear'd full of Condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Favours: But Young <hi>Conde,</hi> is as full of his <hi>Merits</hi> and brave <hi>Exploits;</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what <hi>Services,</hi> he has done to this <hi>Crown.</hi> Beſides, he is not void of Suſpicion and Jealouſie, leſt all thoſe Exceſſes of <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Kindneſs are ſtrain'd, only to render him more ſecure, and ſo entrap him a ſecond Time with greater Advantage. The Horror of his Firſt <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> is yet fix'd in his Mind; from whence it will not be eaſy to efface it. Three Principal Servants of the <hi>Queen,</hi> were Baniſh'd, to remove his Fears: For, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd them to be Inſtruments of Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the <hi>Queen</hi> and his old Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

                  <p>And this <hi>Moon,</hi> the King being come of <hi>Age,</hi> invited the <hi>Prince</hi> to the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual on ſuch Occaſions: Which <hi>Conde</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as a Snare, and ſo fled out of <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Event of theſe Emergencies, is yet in the <hi>Secret Pages</hi> of <hi>Deſtiny:</hi> But in all Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, a <hi>Civil War</hi> will follow. People are whiſpering, caballing and making <hi>Parties</hi> on both Sides. All the Powder in <hi>Paris,</hi> is engroſſed and gone; but no body knows by whom. Some ſay, the <hi>Prince</hi> is poſted into <hi>Flanders;</hi> others report, that he is retir'd to his own <hi>Government,</hi> there to raiſe an Army. The moſt knowing averr, That wherever he is, he has Two Hundred Thouſand <hi>Sequins</hi> in Bank, to give Life to his New Deſigns, let them be what they will.</p>
                  <p>Think not this News of ſmall Importance, Serene <hi>Baſſa:</hi> But when thou heareſt of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> eſpecially in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Firſt</hi> and moſt <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Empire</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> look on thy <hi>Right</hi> Hand and on thy <hi>Left;</hi> for our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> or his <hi>Herald,</hi> is near at Hand.</p>

                  <p>I Have not the Honour to know thee in Perſon, but have heard of thy Fame. So <hi>Mortals</hi> are unacquainted with the <hi>Secrets</hi> of the <hi>Fixed Stars;</hi> yet we obſerve their Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre and Rank, and the Figure they make in thoſe <hi>Remote Worlds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thy Exploits among the <hi>Curds</hi> and <hi>Georgians,</hi> are not unknown in theſe <hi>Parts.</hi> The <hi>Franks</hi> that travel in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> have tranſported hither ſuch a Character of thy Magnanimous Actions, as makes all Men of Honour in Love with thee: And I have conceiv'd a particular Veneration for thy Vertues. May <hi>God</hi> encreaſe them with thy Hours, and grant thee a <hi>Monopoly</hi> of <hi>Bliſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art plac'd in an <hi>Eminent Seat,</hi> and may'ſt with Reaſon be call'd <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> as thy <hi>Title</hi> imports; for thou art <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> of the <hi>Terreſtrial Paradiſe,</hi> if we may give. Credit to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Ancients.</hi> They tell us, that for a Time <hi>Adam</hi> dwelt there, with his <hi>Second Wife,</hi> and that the particular Place of his Abode was an <hi>Iſland,</hi> encompaſs'd with the Rivers <hi>Euphrates, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris, Piſon,</hi> and <hi>Gihon.</hi> From whence it was call'd <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> by the <hi>Greeks;</hi> Which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102962:110"/>ſignifies, <hi>A Region environ'd with Rivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> have a profound Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for this <hi>Country.</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> relate ſtrange Stories of a <hi>Tree</hi> in <hi>Dierbekir,</hi> which grew Five Hundred Miles high, in the Days of <hi>Adam;</hi> which they ſay, was cut down by an <hi>Angel,</hi> leſt <hi>Man,</hi> ſhould climb to <hi>Heaven</hi> by it before his Time. For, it ſeems, <hi>Ambition</hi> was a <hi>Vice,</hi> early as our Nature; and <hi>Adam</hi> was no ſooner ſenſible that he was a <hi>Man,</hi> but he aſpir'd to be a <hi>God,</hi> or ſomething like One: So great a Charm there is in Honour and Authority.</p>
                  <p>They ſay alſo, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was born in this <hi>Region.</hi> However, 'tis certain, if there be any Certainty in <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> that he reſided there a conſiderable Time. But thou knoweſt beſt, what <hi>Traditions</hi> thy <hi>Subjects</hi> have of theſe Things.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chineſe</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> laugh at all this, as a <hi>Romance</hi> of <hi>Later Date,</hi> than their <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles;</hi> which make thoſe Extremities of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to be the <hi>Stage</hi> of the <hi>firſt Mortals.</hi> Inſtead of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> or <hi>Alileth,</hi> they aſſert the <hi>Names</hi> of the <hi>Original Parents</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> to be <hi>Panzon</hi> and <hi>Panzona:</hi> Whoſe <hi>Off-ſpring,</hi> they ſay, continu'd Ten Millions of Years; but at length, were all deſtroy'd from the <hi>Earth,</hi> by a <hi>Tempeſt</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> After whom, they tell us, <hi>God</hi> created <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizam,</hi> a Man with <hi>Two Horns,</hi> each as big and tall as a <hi>Tree</hi> in that Country, which they call the <hi>Plant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> being the Largeſt and Firſt of all <hi>Vegetables.</hi> This Man's
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102962:110"/>
                     <hi>Horns</hi> being Prolifick, according to their <hi>Tradition;</hi> out of the <hi>Right,</hi> ſprang a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men every Day for a Hundred Years; and as many Women out of the <hi>Left,</hi> in the ſame Space. From whom deſcended all <hi>Mortals</hi> of both <hi>Sexes</hi> to this Day; tho' we are much diminiſh'd in Bulk, through the General Decay of <hi>Human Nature.</hi> For, theſe <hi>People</hi> affirm, That the <hi>Firſt Race</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> were all <hi>Gyants:</hi> But that through Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and other Vices, their <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> ſhrunk by degrees into ſmaller Dimenſions, till at Length they arriv'd at the preſent Stature, and appear'd like <hi>Pigmies</hi> in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Sons of <hi>Loutizam.</hi> In Confirmation of this the <hi>Indians</hi> ſhew to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,</hi> ſome of their <hi>Temples</hi> hewn out of vaſt Rocks, with the <hi>Images</hi> of thoſe <hi>Gigantick</hi> Men, who they ſay, were employ'd in the Work. Theſe they honour, as <hi>Hero's</hi> or <hi>Demi-Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not relate this for Truth, but only to divert thee, in repreſenting the different O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Men. <hi>God</hi> only knows, how to ſeparate the <hi>Truth</hi> from <hi>Falſhood</hi> in <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Dierbekir:</hi> This <hi>Country</hi> is Famous for the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> built by <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his <hi>Followers;</hi> at what Time, the <hi>Languages</hi> were confounded, as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates. 'Tis Remarkable alſo, for the Battel fought between the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> at <hi>Harran,</hi> and for the Death of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racalla,</hi> the Son of <hi>Severus, Emperour</hi> of

                     <hi>Rome,</hi> who was Murdered by <hi>Macrinus,</hi> the <hi>Roman General.</hi> Theſe <hi>Emperors</hi> were all call'd <hi>Caeſars,</hi> as the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> were call'd <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> and <hi>Ptolomies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> It ſeems, the Word <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was firſt apply'd to <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>Roman Dictator,</hi> for that his Mother dying under the Pains which were to give him Life, her Belly was ript up, and he drawn forth from her Womb by the Hands of a <hi>Surgeon.</hi> In Memory of which, he and all his <hi>Succeſſors</hi> were call'd <hi>Caeſars;</hi> that Word ſignifying [drawn forth by Violence] But, whatſoever the Manner of his Birth was, this is Certain, that he and Forty of his <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri'd out of the World, by untimely Death: For, they either laid Violent Hands on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or were Murder'd by <hi>Traytors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wou'dſt have any News out of theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> the Chief Diſcourſe at Preſent is, of a great Victory obtain'd by the <hi>Polanders</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars.</hi> And I cou'd wiſh this were all: But the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> are continually made joyful, with the Succeſs of the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the Arms of the <hi>Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Empire.</hi> They beat us by <hi>Sea,</hi> and baffle all our Attempts by <hi>Land.</hi> We have not got an Inch of Ground in <hi>Candia,</hi> during the laſt <hi>Campaigne,</hi> but loſt many Thouſands of Men, and brought the Name of the <hi>Sublime Port</hi> and <hi>Victorious Muſſulmans,</hi> into Contempt and Scorn. Where the Fault lies, <hi>God</hi> knows. 'Tis too Melancholy a <hi>Theme,</hi> to inſiſt on Particulars.</p>

                  <p>THou haſt formerly received a Letter from me, wherein I mentioned the <hi>Tenets</hi> of a certain <hi>French Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> who maintains, That the <hi>Earth</hi> moves like the Reſt of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtands ſtill, being the <hi>Center</hi> of this our <hi>World:</hi> For he aſſerts, that there are <hi>Many.</hi>

                  <p>The Name of this <hi>Sage</hi> is <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned throughout the World for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Knowledge. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> lays as a <hi>Baſis</hi> of all his <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> this ſhort <hi>Poſition</hi> and <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I THINK; THEREFORE I AM.</hi> In this alone he is <hi>Dogmatical,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing a Lawful <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> in all the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain <hi>Deductions</hi> which may be drawn from it.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me, <hi>Oraculous Sage,</hi> if I expoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee my Infirmities. I am Naturally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful of all Things. This Temper puts me upon Perpetual <hi>Thinking.</hi> And that very Act convinces me, of the <hi>Truth</hi> of my <hi>Being,</hi> according to the Method of this <hi>Philoſopher.</hi> But <hi>What</hi> I am, I know not. Sometimes I Phancy my ſelf, no more than a <hi>Dream</hi> or <hi>Idea</hi> of all thoſe other Things, which Men commonly believe do Really Exiſt: A mere Imagination of Poſſibilities. And, that all which we call the <hi>World,</hi> is but One Grand <hi>Chimaera,</hi> or <hi>Nothing</hi> in <hi>Maſquerade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At other Times, when theſe wild Thoughts are vaniſhed, and my Spirits tired in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſuch Abſtracted Whimſies begin to flag, and that my Lower Sence awak'd by ſome preſent Pain or Pleaſure, rouzes my ſleeping Appetites: When I am touch'd with Hunger, Thirſt, or Cold, or Heat, and find experimentally, I am Something that cannot be a mere Thought or Dream, but of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which ſtands in Need of Meat, Drink, Garments, and other Neceſſaries: Then, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fret my ſelf with Vain and Endleſs
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:102962:113"/>Scrutinies, I tamely conclude, I am that which they call a <hi>Man,</hi> I lay the <hi>Sceptick</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny farther Scruples or Doubts, fall roundly to eating, drinking, or any other Refreſhments my Nature craves for.</p>
                  <p>But no ſooner have I taſted theſe Delights, when my Old Diſtemper returns again. I then conſider my ſelf as a <hi>Being,</hi> capable of Happineſs or Miſery in ſome Degree, as I ſhall poſſeſs or Want thoſe very Delights I juſt before enjoyed. This is a ſufficient Damp to a Thinking Man, when he knows, that he ſtands in Need of any Thing out of himſelf. But 'tis far greater, when he will take the Pains to number all the Train of his Particular Neceſſities, which he is not ſure he ſhall always be able to ſupply.</p>
                  <p>This makes me preſently conclude, That as I am Indebted to Other Creatures for my ſenſible Happineſs, ſo I owe my very <hi>Being</hi> to Something beſide my ſelf. I examine my <hi>Original,</hi> and find I am born of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were in the ſame Indigent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances as my ſelf: And that it is not only ſo with my Particular Family, but with all Mankind; our whole Human Race, being born <hi>Natural Mendicants</hi> from the <hi>Womb.</hi> As ſoon as we breath the Vital Air, we Cry; and with thoſe <hi>Inarticulate Prayers,</hi> beg for Help and Protection from others, without whoſe generous Aid we could not ſubſiſt a Moment: So poor and beggarly a Thing is Man, from his Birth. This is the Condition
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102962:114"/>of all: Neither is a <hi>King</hi> any more ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>empt from this <hi>Common Character</hi> of <hi>Mortals</hi> than the <hi>Slave</hi> who <hi>ſweeps</hi> the <hi>Streets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I could have reſted in this Thought, I ſhould have been happy: For it would have had this Influence on me, either to convince me, that I ought to be content with the Condition to which I was born, or to rid my ſelf out of ſo deſpicable a State by Death.</p>
                  <p>But alas, one Thought produces another: And from the Contemplation of our preſent Miſery in this <hi>Life,</hi> I fall to thinking what will become of us after <hi>Death.</hi> For, as we know not <hi>What,</hi> or <hi>Where</hi> we were before we came into this <hi>World;</hi> ſo there is no Human Certainty, <hi>Whither</hi> we ſhall go, or in <hi>What Condition</hi> we ſhall be, when we leave it: And therefore, it would be an unpardonable Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to throw my ſelf headlong into a State of which I have no Account: And, to avoid the Little Miſeries of this Life, which muſt have an End one Time or other, caſt my ſelf down a <hi>Precipice</hi> (for ought I know) of <hi>Intolerable Torments,</hi> which has no <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hear the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> talk of <hi>Immortality,</hi> the <hi>Poets</hi> of <hi>Elyzium,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtian Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Heaven, Hell,</hi> and <hi>Pargatory;</hi> the <hi>Indian Bramins</hi> of <hi>Tranſmigration.</hi> But I know not <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>which</hi> I have Reaſon to believe, of <hi>all theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:102962:114"/>
                  <p>I ſpeak after the Manner of <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> for, if we come to <hi>Faith,</hi> the Caſe is altered. Think not, I beſeech thee, that I call in Queſtion the <hi>Sacred Oracles,</hi> the <hi>Revelations</hi> of the <hi>ſent</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But I only acquaint thee, how my <hi>Natural Reaſon</hi> hatters me with Doubts.</p>
                  <p>I ſee Men every where profeſſing ſome <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> or other; paying <hi>Divine Honours</hi> to ſome <hi>Superiour Being,</hi> or <hi>Beings,</hi> according as they have been Educated: Which many Times tempts me to think, that <hi>Religion</hi> is Nothing but the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Education.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then I wonder, how Men when they come to Years of Diſcretion, and their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is able to Diſtinguiſh between Things <hi>probable,</hi> and mere <hi>Romances,</hi> can ſtill retain the <hi>Errors</hi> of their <hi>Infancy.</hi> 'Tis Natural for Children, to be wheadled or aw'd into a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of what their <hi>Parents, Nurſes,</hi> or <hi>Tutors</hi> teach them. But when they come of Age, they ſoon rectify their miſled Underſtandings, in all Things, ſave the Affairs of <hi>Religion.</hi> In this they are Children ſtill, tenacious of the <hi>Sacred Fables</hi> of their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in maintaining them, ſometimes even to Death.</p>
                  <p>It puzzles me to find out the Cauſe of ſo ſtrange an Effect, That Men otherwiſe endu'd with Mature Judgments, and an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sagacity in all Things elſe, ſhould yet be <hi>Fools</hi> in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and believe Things <hi>Inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Common Sence</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:102962:115"/>
                  <p>I could never give Credit to the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Pagans,</hi> which acquaint us with the devout <hi>Adoration</hi> they paid to the <hi>Creatures</hi> of the <hi>Painter</hi> or <hi>Carver,</hi> did not I ſee the ſame practiſed among the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Or, that thoſe <hi>Wiſe</hi> Men of Old, cou'd ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Forgeries of their <hi>Prieſts</hi> concerning their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> were I not an Eye-Witneſs, how bigotted the Modern <hi>Nazarenes</hi> are to the <hi>Legends</hi> of their <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> to thoſe more Ridiculous <hi>Figments</hi> of the <hi>Talmud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It perplexes me, to ſee <hi>Mankind</hi> generally labouring under ſo great a Darkneſs, not ſo much the Effect of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition:</hi> To behold Men well vers'd in <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Humane Learning;</hi> yet Zealous Aſſertors of manifeſt Contradictions in Matters of <hi>Divinity,</hi> rather than oppoſe, or ſo much as examine the <hi>Traditions</hi> of their <hi>Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I behold <hi>Mankind</hi> divided into ſo many innumerable Different <hi>Religions</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> all vigorouſly propagating their own <hi>Tenets,</hi> either by Subtilty or Violence, yet few or none ſeeming by their Practice to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what they with ſo much Ardour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs; I could almoſt think, that theſe various Ways of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> were firſt invented by <hi>Politicians;</hi> each accommodating his <hi>Model,</hi> to the Inclinations of the <hi>People</hi> whom he deſign'd to <hi>Circumvent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when on the other ſide I conſider, there appears ſomething ſo <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd,</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:102962:115"/>in the <hi>Furious</hi> Zeal, and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconquera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Obſtinacy of the <hi>Greateſt</hi> Part; I am as ready to Joyn with <hi>Cardan,</hi> and conclude, That all this <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Religions,</hi> depends on the Different <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Stars.</hi> This was a famous <hi>Philoſopher</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> and held, That the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ow'd its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal to the Force of <hi>Saturn,</hi> that of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and Ours to <hi>Mars.</hi> As for the <hi>Pagans,</hi> he aſſigns to them ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Conſtellations</hi> and <hi>Aſpects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus there is ſo equal an Appearance of Truth and Falſhood in Every <hi>Religion,</hi> that I ſhould not know how, in Human Reaſon, to fix on any.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>'TWas the Contemplation of <hi>Iſouf Eb'n Hadrilla,</hi> an <hi>Arabian Philoſopher,</hi> That all Men were at Firſt <hi>Created</hi> in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>War:</hi> For this <hi>Sage,</hi> gave no Credit to the <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh Hiſtorian</hi> and <hi>Prophet;</hi> neither cou'd any Arguments perſwade him to believe, That all <hi>Mortals</hi> deſcended from <hi>Adam.</hi> 'Twas an <hi>Article</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> That in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> Men were <hi>Form'd</hi> of the <hi>Prolifick Slime</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> Impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Vigorous <hi>Warmth</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and that all other <hi>Animals</hi> had their <hi>Original</hi> in the ſame Manner: But that in Proceſs of Time, the Richneſs of the <hi>Seminal Soyl</hi> being exhauſted by a continual <hi>Spontaneons Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Living Creatures, there was no other Way to perpetuate the Various Kinds of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and multiply the <hi>Individuals,</hi> but by the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Method of <hi>Generation.</hi> For which Reaſon, <hi>Nature</hi> ſeems to have ſubdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided every <hi>Species</hi> into Two <hi>Sexes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence, this <hi>Philoſopher</hi> concludes, That at Firſt there was no nearer Relation between Man and Man, than there is now betwixt a Lyon and a Sheep, or any other different Kinds of Animals: Saving onely, that as theſe are diſtinguiſh'd by their <hi>Forms,</hi> into Four-Footed Beaſts, Fowls, Fiſhes, and Creeping
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102962:117"/>Things; ſo Men aſſum'd to themſelves, the Character of <hi>Rational</hi> Creatures: And a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of <hi>Self-Preſervation,</hi> was the Firſt Ground of a Tacite and Common <hi>League</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men, againſt the Reſt of their Fellow-Animals: Eſpecially againſt thoſe, which made a more frightful Figure on Earth than we do, and ſeem'd more Rapacious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Miſchief; ſuch as Dragons, Tygers, Bears, Lions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this General Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Race,</hi> againſt the more Salvage and Fierce Troops of Beaſts; yet one Man ſtill ſtood upon his Guard againſt another. And all the <hi>Sons</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> endeavour'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Poſts, which <hi>Nature</hi> had alotted each Man; That is, the Place where he was firſt Form'd, and drew Breath. But Things cou'd not laſt long in this State: For, either by <hi>Inſtinct</hi> or <hi>Reaſon</hi> (call it which you will, ſays this <hi>Author</hi>) Men being ſtreightened for want of Fruits, or ſpurr'd on by ſome ſecret Deſire of Novelty, ſoon went out of their Bounds, and encounter'd each other, more by Chance than Deſign: Whence aroſe, the Firſt Occaſions of Actual War. For, every <hi>Stranger,</hi> appear'd like an <hi>Invader:</hi> They Naturally ſtartled and ſuſpected each other. Reciprocal Paſſions of Choler ſprung in their Breaſts; and every Man to prevent the Effect of his own Fears and Apprehenſions, ruſh'd on his Neighbour, who was on the ſame Ground as ready for an Aſſault as himſelf. Thus, an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal War</hi> Commenc'd in the <hi>World</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:102962:117"/>which by various Methods of Improvement, was carry'd on by the Succeeding <hi>Generations,</hi> and continu'd to the Preſent Times.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Governments,</hi> the Particular Time cannot be determin'd; but it may be ſuppoſed, That Men Generally find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inconvenience of theſe private Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Combats, and by Degrees arriving to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Maturity of Experience, form'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Firſt into little <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,</hi> or as they dwelt near one another, or as they agreed in ſome Common Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, Principles, and Intereſts. From which Small <hi>Aſſociations,</hi> they gradually ſpread into Larger <hi>Communities,</hi> living under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws and Obligations of Mutual Peace, Juſtice and Aſſiſtance toward each other, and of Defence againſt their Common Enemies: Some living under the Form of a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> Others of a <hi>Monarchy;</hi> each <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> ſetting up ſuch a <hi>Model,</hi> as beſt ſuited their own Intereſts and Neceſſities. From hence ſprung the Diſtinction of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Empires.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Arabian Philoſopher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But without enquiring into the Truth of his <hi>Principles,</hi> one wou'd think, that ſome of theſe <hi>Weſtern Nazarenes</hi> were his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> And indeed, all <hi>Civil</hi> Diſſentions, ſeem to be grounded on the ſame <hi>Maxims:</hi> Whilſt Men on the leaſt Diſcontent or Jealouſie, lay aſide the Obedience they owe to their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,</hi> claiming I know not what <hi>Natural Right,</hi> to defend themſelves againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102962:118"/>and Uſurpations of others.</p>
                  <p>Thus, no ſooner was it ſuppos'd here, that the <hi>King</hi> intended to recall <hi>Cardinal Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> from his <hi>Exile;</hi> bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s taking up Arms, has more puzzl'd the Counſels of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and more embaraſs'd his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, than any Occurrence that has happen'd ſince the Death of his Father.</p>
                  <p>I have already inform'd the <hi>Kaimacham</hi> and others, of all Paſſages hitherto, relating to theſe <hi>Inteſtine Broils.</hi> Since which they ſeem to be improv'd into a <hi>War,</hi> wherein <hi>Foreign Nations</hi> take a Part. After the Return of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> to this <hi>Court,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was driven to great Streights, being compell'd by the ſwift Marches of the <hi>King</hi>'s Army, to retire to <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> Where, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it would not be ſo much his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to keep this Place, as to encreaſe his Forces, he ſent <hi>Envoys</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Arch-Duke Leopold</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> to deſire their Aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Former</hi> immediately diſpatched away Orders for a conſiderable Body of Men to approach the Confides of <hi>Gaſcoigne</hi> where the <hi>Prince</hi> had a great Intereſt; And the <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> lent him Eight Thouſand Men, to act on the ſide of <hi>Flanders</hi> and towards <hi>Paris,</hi> as Occaſion offer'd.</p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:102962:119"/>
                  <p>This is the particular Game of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to take Advantage of the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that ſo by aſſiſting the weaker Party, they may balance the Conteſting <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and keep 'em in a perpetual Quarrel: Whilſt in the <hi>Interim,</hi> they gain Ground; recover the Places which the <hi>French</hi> took from 'em in Time of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick</hi> Peace, and ſo pave the Way to <hi>New Conqueſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſent <hi>Deputies</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> beſeeching him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his <hi>Royal</hi> Word, by which he had for ever baniſh'd <hi>Cardinal Mazarini;</hi> and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him the Fatal Conſequences, which were like to proceed from his Return. But the <hi>King,</hi> inſtead of complying with their Requeſts, caus'd an <hi>Edict</hi> of <hi>Council</hi> to be Publiſh'd, which juſtify'd his Conduct in this Matter.</p>
                  <p>He alſo writ a Letter to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> full of Complaints, that they had not yet publiſh'd any <hi>Order,</hi> to hinder the Entrance of a <hi>Foreign Army</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But all ſignified Nothing, to Men paſſionately bent, to maintain the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt their <hi>Sovereign.</hi> He has but few truſty Men in that <hi>Senate,</hi> and they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw'd by the Reſt. Beſides, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> bears a ſtrange Sway both in the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>

                  <p>At the Inſtigation of the <hi>Prince,</hi> the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhut up their Gates, when they heard the <hi>King</hi> was coming that Way in

                  <p>There have been many Skirmiſhes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters, between the <hi>King</hi>'s Forces, and thoſe of the <hi>Male-contents;</hi> and one fierce Combat, wherein the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> defeated the <hi>Vanguard</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s Army, as he was marching to this City. Whereby getting the Start of his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> he arriv'd here, and was receiv'd in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Monarch</hi> was forc'd to lie encamp'd in the Field.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> found a different Reception, according to the various Humours of People.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle</hi> to the preſent <hi>King:</hi> Whereby he has a Right to aſſume more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than others, in regulating the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Court;</hi> among which, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt is eſteem'd, that of <hi>Cardinal Mazari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>'s Return.</p>

                  <p>In a Word, both Parties ſerve themſelves of thoſe who have the greateſt Intereſt, and are moſt likely to compoſe the Quarrel. The Exil'd <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and her Son, who have taken <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> from the <hi>Perſecutions</hi> of their <hi>Own Subjects,</hi> make it their Buſineſs, to mediate between the <hi>Court</hi>-Party, and the <hi>Faction</hi> of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> alſo, ſent <hi>Deputies</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> to repreſent to him, That the only Means to give Quiet to the <hi>State,</hi> was to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Cardinal-Miniſter;</hi> And as they were delivering their Addreſs, <hi>Mazarini</hi> came in; at the Sight of whom, they aggravated their Charge, and ſaid to his Face, <hi>That he was the Cauſe of all the EVILS, which the Kingdom ſuffer'd.</hi> The <hi>Cardinal</hi> Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, turn'd to the <hi>King,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Sir, It will not be Juſt, that ſo Flouriſhing a Kingdom, and, to whoſe Grandeur I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all that lay in my Power, ſhould ruin it ſelf for my Sake: Therefore I humbly entreat your Majeſty to grant, that I may return to my own Country, or whitherſoever my Fortune ſhall call me. No, no,</hi> reply'd the <hi>Queen</hi> (not without ſome Paſſion) <hi>This cannot be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The King had never more need of your Counſels, than at this Juncture. We cannot conſent, that ſo Serviceable a Man ſhould be Baniſh'd, only to humour his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Therefore, let us hear no more of that.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Deputies</hi> perceiving nothing of Hopes, return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> Then the <hi>Parliament</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted others to go to the <hi>King,</hi> and Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Deplorable Crate of the <hi>Realm.</hi> This was done a few Days agoe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, we have been alarm'd here in this City, with daily Inſurrections of the Multitude.

This being miſunderſtood by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have not the Sence to diſtinguiſh the Good Offices of their <hi>Governours</hi> from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, put 'em all into a Tumult. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the <hi>Provoſt</hi> in his Coach, as he was paſſing the Streets: And had he not eſcaped into an <hi>Apothecary</hi>'s Shop, they wou'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in their Fury, have torn him in Pieces; For ſo they ſerv'd his Coach, as an after. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
                  <p>I am weary of beholding the Malicious Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of theſe <hi>Infidels.</hi> But when I conſider, that their Diſcords will be Inſtrumental to the Future Conqueſts of the <hi>True Believers,</hi> I am Patient and Reſign'd.</p>
                  <p>However, 'tis one Comfort to me in this Thorny <hi>Station,</hi> that one Time or other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the perpetual jangling of Bells in <hi>Paris,</hi> I may again have the Happineſs, to hear the <hi>Muezins</hi> cry on the <hi>Minarets</hi> in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, There is but One God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>his Prophet.</hi> Or, if I ſhall not live to enjoy this Wiſh; yet, in the <hi>Inviſible State,</hi> I
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102962:121"/>ſhall hear the ſame Cry, and ſhall be paſt Doubt of thoſe Things, whereof I have no Certainty in this Life.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſeem to have too proud an Opinion of themſelves, and ſet a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Value on <hi>Humane Nature</hi> than ſuits with Reaſon. They aſſert, That all Things were made for Man, and ſtyle him <hi>Lord</hi> of his <hi>Fellow-Creatures;</hi> as if <hi>God</hi> had given him an Abſolute Dominion over the <hi>Reſt</hi> of his <hi>Works,</hi> eſpecially over the <hi>Animal-Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and that all the Birds of the Air, Beaſts of the Earth, and Fiſh of the Sea, were Created onely to ſerve his Appetite and other Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Life. I remember a Letter I formerly ſent to thee, wherein I diſcours'd of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian Philoſophers,</hi> and their Contempt of the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> in denying them <hi>Souls,</hi> or the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Give me leave to entertain thee now, and divert my ſelf with ſome farther Remarks on this Subject. 'Tis a Refuge from Melancholy,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102962:122"/>when I can thus freely diſcover my Thoughts to a Friend, who I know will not be Partial to the Truth.</p>
                  <p>I have been long an Advocate for the <hi>Brutes,</hi> and have endeavour'd both to abſtain from injuring them my ſelf, and to inculcate this Fundamental Point of Juſtice to others. This is owing to the <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> of <hi>Mahummed,</hi> the <hi>Eremite</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> that <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Religious</hi> Men. And were it not that my Humour is to be doubtful in all Things, the Influence of his Converſation would make me a profeſs'd <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of the <hi>Indian Brachmans,</hi> a <hi>Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for the <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> of <hi>Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Letter ſave one I writ to that <hi>Solitary,</hi> was upon this Subject: Such an one as wou'd divert him in his <hi>Cave.</hi> It contain'd an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Primitive</hi> Manner of Life pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by the <hi>Ancients,</hi> a <hi>Narrative</hi> of the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Human Innocence,</hi> and the <hi>Steps</hi> which Men firſt took, to uſe <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> to their <hi>Fellow-Creatures.</hi> Now I will preſent thee with ſome Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obſervations, ſome Remnants of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Truth, glean'd from <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> and winnow'd from the <hi>Chaff</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who wou'd not believe the <hi>Beaſts</hi> to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> when he beholds them perform all the Actions of <hi>Rational</hi> Creatures, with more Caution, tho' leſs Pride than Men? They are more Provident than We, and much more ſubtile in avoiding any Affliction or
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102962:122"/>Danger. Witneſs <hi>Thales</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi>'s <hi>Mule,</hi> which he often employ'd to carry Salt to a certain Market; but the Cunning <hi>Beaſt</hi> finding herſelf over-loaded, when ſhe was paſſing through a River lay down, whereby the Water penetrating into the Sacks of Salt, melted it away and lightned her Burden. And this was her Conſtant Practice; till the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> perceiving himſelf thus outwitted by his <hi>Beaſt,</hi> was reſolv'd to circumvent her another way. Wherefore, inſtead of Salt he loaded her with Wool, which he knew would grow heavier by being Wet. But the wary <hi>Mule,</hi> ſenſible of the Difference of her Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, wou'd couch no more in the Water; but ſeeing no other Remedy, went forward on her Journey.</p>
                  <p>Who will not admire the Wiſdom of the <hi>Fox</hi> in <hi>Cold Countreys,</hi> which the Inhabitants uſe as a Guide when they would paſs over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Frozen Lake or River. For this Creature going before them, lays her Ears cloſe down to the Ice, and liſtens to try if ſhe can hear any Motion or Noiſe of the Water running underneath: Which if ſhe does, ſhe will not venture on the Ice; but if all be ſtill, then by a <hi>Logical Deduction</hi> ſhe concludes, The Ice is thick enough to bear Paſſengers; and ſo ſhe leads the Way, whilſt the Men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>When a <hi>Dog</hi> is hunting in the thick Woods, and by chance comes to a Place where <hi>Three</hi> Paths meet, he firſt Scents the <hi>One,</hi> then the <hi>Other:</hi> And perceiving that the Game is not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102962:123"/>gone by any of thoſe <hi>Two Ways;</hi> he throws himſelf ſwiftly forward in the <hi>Third,</hi> without ſuch a particular Application of his Noſe. Which is an evident Argument, that he makes uſe of the like Caſe we our Selves ſhould do.</p>
                  <p>And now I have mention'd this Creature, I cannot forbear celebrating their Virtue and Fidelity: Whereof we have daily Experience; and there are many pleaſant <hi>Examples,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by grave <hi>Hiſtorians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such is that of <hi>Hircanus,</hi> a <hi>Dog</hi> belonging to <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> who would never depart from the Body of his dead Maſter, but following it to the <hi>Funeral Pile,</hi> leapt into the Fire, and was burned for Company.</p>
                  <p>But the Gratitude of a <hi>Lyon</hi> to a certain <hi>Slave</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> is beyond all Parallel. This <hi>Slave</hi> was one of thoſe, who were appointed to combat with <hi>Wild Beaſts</hi> in the <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of the Ancient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in the <hi>Publick Shews</hi> which were exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the People. As ſoon as the <hi>Lyon</hi> was let looſe in the Pavement, he ran furiouſly at the <hi>Slave,</hi> but coming nearer, he ſtop'd on a ſudden, as one aſtoniſhed: Then he came gently toward the <hi>Slave,</hi> fawning upon him, and licking his Hand, which caus'd all the People to give a Shout. The <hi>Emperour</hi> being preſent, and taking Notice of the ſeeming Friendſhip and Acquaintance that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Slave</hi> and the <hi>Lyon,</hi> ſent for the <hi>Slave,</hi> and enquired the Occaſion of ſo ſtrange an Accident. To whom the <hi>Slave</hi> made the following Relation:</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:102962:123"/>
                  <p>
                     <q>My Name, ſaid he, is <hi>Andredus,</hi> and I am <hi>Slave</hi> to a certain <hi>Proconſul,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving determined to Kill me, I made my Eſcape, and hid my ſelf in a Cave: Where I had not lain long, before this <hi>Lyon,</hi> which you now ſee, came in, being very lame of one Foot. As ſoon as he ſpy'd me, he came limping toward me, and ſtretch'd forth the Paw that was Wounded, as tho' he begg'd of me to eaſe him. Affrighted as I was, I took his Paw in my Hand, and pull'd out a great ragged Thorn, which ſtuck faſt in it. Then I waſh'd the Wound with my own Water, whilſt he lay very patiently till I throughly dreſs'd it. The Eaſe he found by my Application, made him fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep; and when he wak'd, he lick'd my Hands, and ſhew'd other Signs of Affection and Gratitude. I liv'd with him thus, Three Years in that Cave, and every Day he brought me a Share of his Prey, on which I ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd my Self. But at Length Tyr'd with this Manner of Life, I took my Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, when he was gone abroad, to make my Eſcape. I wander'd up and down Three days, when a Company of Soldiers meeting with me, and knowing to whom I belong'd, took me and brought me hither to my <hi>Old Maſter,</hi> who has Condemn'd me to this Cruel Death. But it ſeems, <hi>Fortune</hi> ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it, that this <hi>Lyon</hi> ſhould be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame Time, and appointed to be my <hi>Executioner</hi> this Day. Yet you ſee, he refuſes to perform his Office, out of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102962:124"/>to me for my former Kindneſs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> aſtoniſh'd and pleas'd at this Paſſage, gave the <hi>Slave</hi> his Life and Freedom, beſtowing alſo the <hi>Lyon</hi> on him, which brought him in a Conſtant Livelyhood, by ſhewing him to all People; who having heard of this Wonderful Accident, were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſee both the <hi>Lyon</hi> and his <hi>Tenant:</hi> For ſo they ſtyl'd the <hi>Slave;</hi> and ſome call'd him, the <hi>Lyons Phyſician.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhould think I had ſaid enough already to tire thy Patience, and make thee forſwear reading my Letters for the future, were I not well acquainted with thy <hi>Genius,</hi> and know that thou delighteſt in Relations of this Nature, being no Enemy to the harmleſs Brutes.</p>
                  <p>Whatever thy Sentiments are towards theſe, I dare be ſure, thou art my Friend, and wilt bear with my Importunity, when I ſtrive to convince all Men, and confirm my ſelf in this Truth, That the <hi>Wild Beaſts</hi> are not void of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Moral Vertue.</hi>

                  <p>My Spirit is diſquieted about theſe Things, and I am uneaſy by Day, neither does the Night accord me any Repoſe. This hot Weather, I go up to the <hi>Terraſs</hi> of my <hi>Houſe</hi> at the <hi>Hour</hi> of <hi>Sleep,</hi> thinking that the Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Air would incline me to Reſt; but I can find none.

                     <q>That at the Moment, when the <hi>Moon</hi> firſt Aſcended our <hi>Horizen,</hi> an <hi>Intellectual</hi> Splendor might ſhine in my Breaſt: That I might there, as in a <hi>Mirror,</hi> behold the <hi>Future Fate</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> and the <hi>Events,</hi> which as yet, were hid in the <hi>Dark Womb</hi> of <hi>Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>My <hi>Petition</hi> was granted: The <hi>Night</hi> was in her <hi>Shady Courſe;</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> on their <hi>Watch;</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> as from a <hi>Limbeck,</hi> deſtill'd the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Minutes, till the Moment wherein the Neighbour-<hi>Planet,</hi> firſt peep'd on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ops of Mountains. At that Inſtant I ſaw, and heard Things (or at leaſt I thought ſo) which I never ſo much as dreamt of before, neither can I remember the Thouſandth Part.</p>
                  <p>Believe me, <hi>Supreme Commander</hi> of the <hi>Marine,</hi> I do not boaſt, or Joy in this.

                     <p>Methinks I beheld <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> (for I thought 'em to be ſuch by their <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bants</hi>) making ſeveral Deſcents on the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102962:125"/>Shores of <hi>Italy:</hi> Methought I ſaw them proſtrate themſelves on the Ground, and after a conſiderable Space of Silence, the Air eccho'd with the Sound of <hi>Allah, Allah,</hi> much like the Noiſe of great <hi>Caſcades,</hi> or <hi>Falls</hi> of <hi>Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then they ſeem'd to diſperſe themſelves all over the Countrey in divers Bodies. The Inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> appear'd all in a great Conſternation. The <hi>Chief Mufti</hi> of that Place, went forthwith into the Streets, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and <hi>Derviſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by an Innumerable Multitude of People. They carried their <hi>Gods</hi> of Gold and Silver along with them; and being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell'd with Garments of coarſe Hair, they ſprinkled Aſhes on their Foreheads, in To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of their Humility, and to pacify the Indignation that was kindled againſt them.</p>
                     <p>But, <hi>Heaven</hi> was deaf to their Clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Vows, neither could all the Pomp of their <hi>Superſtitious</hi> Solemnity, dazle the Eyes which are a Thouſand Times brighter than the <hi>Sun,</hi> penetrating into the darkeſt Corners of the Heart. In a word, theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> ſeem'd a while after to be in a great Confuſion and Hurry, running this Way and that Way to hide their Goods, and ſave themſelves from the Victorious <hi>Strangers.</hi> In fine, I ſaw the <hi>Croſſes</hi> taken down from the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narets</hi> of the <hi>Moſques</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents</hi> advanc'd in their place.</p>

                  <p>I do not relate this, as if I gave Credit to <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Trances:</hi> Perhaps all this might be but a <hi>Waking Dream.</hi> Yet ſuch <hi>Viſionary</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, happen of Courſe to our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, when they obſerve the foreſaid <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> But I tell thee, I am not aſleep at this Moment; and yet it appears to me a very Probable Undertaking, for the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> to fit out a Mighty <hi>Fleet,</hi> which having a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Army of Land-Men aboard, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them with little or no Oppoſition, on ſome of the Wealthy Shores of <hi>Italy:</hi> And if it is not thought worth the Labour to make New Conqueſts, which would be difficult to maintain; yet at leaſt our Soldiers by plunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring only the Rich <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Convents</hi> of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> might carry away Ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Treaſures.</p>
                  <p>I wrote formerly to one of thy <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> about the ſame Matter, propoſing the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of <hi>Loretto,</hi> as a very eaſy Attempt, and that the Booty wou'd infinitely ſurpaſs the Expence and Trouble: But <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices are never regarded, till 'tis too late.

                  <p>It is only a <hi>Maxim</hi> of <hi>Weſtern Policy,</hi> thus to give Diverſion to the Arms which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to ſubdue <hi>All Nations.</hi> They ſport themſelves, to ſee the Flower of the <hi>Eaſtern

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not think this an Impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enterprize, when thou ſhalt conſider the Diviſions of the <hi>Italian Princes,</hi> the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Security and Voluptuouſneſs of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and yet the Oppreſſions and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they live under, being fleec'd and poll'd of all their Subſtance, to maintain the <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi> of their <hi>Governors,</hi> and the <hi>Pride</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> which renders 'em equally diſguſted, at their preſent Slaviſh Manner of Life, and deſirous of a Change. It is not hard to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe after all this, that a Conqueſt wou'd be eaſy to the Victorious <hi>Muſſulmans;</hi> or at leaſt ſuch Depredations, as would mightily enrich them.</p>

At length, they had chas'd him into a Corner of the Land; from whence it was Impoſſible for him to eſcape, but by ſwimming o'er a ſmall Arm of the Sea. What Riſques will not a Man run, for the Love of Liberty?

                  <p>None were ſo hardy, as to follow him through the Uncertain Waves. However, his <hi>Horſe</hi> being of matchleſs Strength, carry'd him ſafe over to the Oppoſite Shore. As ſoon as he arriv'd at the next Town, where he had many Friends, he related this Wonderful Paſſage. But inſtead of cheriſhing his <hi>Horſe,</hi> for ſo Faithful and Invaluable a Service, he drew his Sword, and immediately kill'd the <hi>Beaſt</hi> that had ſav'd his Life: Saying, he did it for the Sake of Fame, being reſolv'd, that

And to compleat the Happineſs of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> he cull'd out ſome of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull'ſt <hi>Mares</hi> of <hi>Arabia</hi> to accompany him; charging alſo, that the Doors of the Stable ſhou'd be always open, for the <hi>Horſe</hi> to go in or out, and range when and where he pleas'd. This was a Generoſity worthy of an <hi>Eaſtern Monarch,</hi> whom, as thy Letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms me, thou haſt in Part imitated.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch is ſome Men's Ambition, and vain Deſire to be talk'd of, that they care not by what barbarous Methods, they accompliſh their Aim: It was a Motive of this Nature, which tempted <hi>Eroſtratus</hi> to ſet Fire to the Famous <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> which had been Two Hundred Years in Building, and was number'd among the <hi>Seven Wonders</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>

                  <p>However, the <hi>Prieſts</hi> made no Jeſt on't; but ran up and down howling and making Gaſhes in their Fleſh, preſaging that <hi>Fate</hi> was that Day buſied, in ſigning the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Aſia</hi>'s Ruine.

                  <p>HAving the Opportunity of a Day or two more, before the <hi>Poſt</hi> goes out of Town, I make uſe of it to ask thee, Whether there be any Notice taken in your <hi>Parts,</hi> of a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> newly appearing above the <hi>Orb</hi> of the <hi>Sun?</hi> It has not been obſerv'd here till with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe few Nights. And the <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> notwithſtanding the Coldneſs of the <hi>Seaſon,</hi> (which I aſſure thee is ſharp enough) are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſy with their <hi>Teleſcopes,</hi> to pry into the Figure of this <hi>Meteor,</hi> and obſerve its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They take great Pains, and endure all the Rigour of the Froſt and Snow, in Hopes of making ſome new Diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>The Vulgarlook on it, as a great <hi>Prodigy:</hi> There are a Thouſand Opinions among them about its Conſequences: Every Body ſets up for a <hi>Judicial Aſtrologer.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Learn'd</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſuch as are eſteem'd Great <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> cannot agree in their Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Some aſſert, That the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Heavens</hi> is ſubject to <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Change,</hi> and that this <hi>Comet</hi> is generated af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Manner: Whilſt others hold a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinion. They are all divided, and diſpute hotly in as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible Terms,</hi> as the <hi>Languages</hi> of <hi>America</hi> are to us of this <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</hi> They amuſe one another, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

All the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments</hi> of the <hi>Opticks,</hi> are ſought out to help their <hi>Sight;</hi> and yet they may be as much in the <hi>Dark,</hi> as the Men in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Cave.</hi> It is an <hi>Article</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> That we Mortals know very little of thoſe far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>Beings.</hi> But, theſe <hi>Franks</hi> are the moſt opinionated People in the World; no Man has the Modeſty, to allow another as much Right to Reaſon as himſelf. Every one ſets up for a <hi>Dogmatiſt,</hi> and requires the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of all others to be reſign'd to his; tho' perhaps, that be only form'd by the Rules of his Parents, the Impreſſions of his Early Years, the Force of Education, the Faſhion of his Country, or by ſome Notable Accident in his Life: All which, are equally liable to Falſhood and Truth. How many <hi>Sects</hi> were there of the <hi>Ancient Philoſophers,</hi> ſtiffly defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſeveral Opinions? One ſays, the <hi>Heavens</hi> are made of Braſs; Another, of Iron; a Third, of Smoke. This will have 'em to be Solid, That Fluid: There is no End of their Controverſies.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, no Man knows What they are made of, or What is the Figure of the <hi>World,</hi> Whether Round or Square, or beyond all Dimenſions: Whether <hi>Matter</hi> be Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Indiviſible in the laſt <hi>Atome.</hi> Who can aſſure me, If there be onely One <hi>World,</hi> or Whether there may not as well be a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

                  <p>Son of my Mother, let not what I have ſaid, paſs for the Words of a Flatterer. Thou know'ſt, I am as free from that Vice, as I am from Envy.

                  <p>THY laſt Letter ſpeaks thee at once willing to be Enlightened, yet Tenacious of thy Old <hi>Prepoſſeſſions.</hi> I wonder not at the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thou findeſt, in ſhaking off the <hi>Precepts</hi> of thy <hi>Rabbi's,</hi> thoſe <hi>Religious Triflers.</hi> The Influence of <hi>Education,</hi> is forcible as that of our <hi>Birth:</hi> And the <hi>Habits</hi> that are root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us in our <hi>Tender Years,</hi> are harder to be diſplanted, than the <hi>Inhorent Affections</hi> of our <hi>Blood:</hi> This is ſignify'd by the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Proverb,</hi> which ſays, <hi>The Tutors of Youth, have an Aſcendant over the Stars of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know it has been eſteem'd the peculiar Glory of thy <hi>Nation,</hi> that you have been Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Obſervers of the <hi>Traditions</hi> of your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> From which, rather than deviate a Title, there have not been wanting ſuch as freely expos'd themſelves, and have bravely endur'd Racks, Scourgings, Burnings, and all Sorts of Torments, even the moſt exquiſite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruel Deaths, that the Malice of <hi>Tyrants</hi> cou'd invent. But do not I know alſo, that in ſome of the moſt Weighty Points of your <hi>Law,</hi> your Zeal has exceeded your Prudence? I ſpeak not of the private Bigotry of <hi>one</hi>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:102962:143"/>Man, or a <hi>few;</hi> but of the <hi>Repreſentative Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> of your Whole <hi>Nation.</hi> How fooliſhly Superſtitious were your Armies in the Days of <hi>Mattathias,</hi> when being aſſaulted by their Enemies on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> Day, they refus'd to draw a Sword in their own Defence, and ſo were all cut off by the Army of <hi>Antiochus?</hi> This is no Invidious Remark of your <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> but the Obſervation of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus,</hi> a Man of the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſprung from the <hi>Stock</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as thy Self.</p>
                  <p>Now tell me thy Opinion, did your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> do well in thus Sacrificing themſelves, and the whole Intereſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to a Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Punctilio</hi> of that Obedience they ow'd the <hi>Law,</hi> or no? If thou alloweſt the Former, then <hi>Mattathias</hi> did Wickedly in making a <hi>Decree,</hi> That from thenceforth, it ſhould be Lawful on the <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> to reſiſt their Enemies; and all the <hi>Jews</hi> were guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Notorious Breaches of the <hi>Law,</hi> in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Decree,</hi> and fighting on the <hi>Sabbath-Day:</hi> But if thou ſay'ſt, They did Ill in not fighting, tho' at a prohibited Time, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited under the Severeſt <hi>Curſes;</hi> then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That there is no <hi>Point</hi> of your <hi>Law,</hi> which may not, nay which ought not to be diſpens'd with, and give way to the Intereſts of <hi>State,</hi> and the Good of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> So that at this Rate, the <hi>Religion</hi> for which you are all ſo Zealous, will appear to be but a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government, Divinely</hi> contriv'd for <hi>Humane</hi> Regards. I do not call in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102962:144"/>the <hi>Miraculous</hi> Delivery of your <hi>Law</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> Suffer me to plead without Suſpicion of Partiality: I do not go about to invalidate the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets.</hi> Doubtleſs, the <hi>Moſt High</hi> came down through the <hi>Heavens,</hi> attended with <hi>Myriads</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> and Thirty Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Chariots of Fire; and when he ſtood on the Top of the <hi>Mountain,</hi> the <hi>Rear</hi> of his <hi>Train</hi> had not paſſed the <hi>Silver Gates</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> appear'd in his Circuit, as one aſtoniſh'd; he bluſh'd, and fled away from the <hi>Eternal Brightneſs,</hi> not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the <hi>Luſtre</hi> of a <hi>Glory</hi> ſo far ſurpaſſing <hi>his own.</hi> The <hi>Stars</hi> were dazl'd at the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Splendor,</hi> and miſtook their Courſes; they run againſt one another in their affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Careers.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Nations</hi> of the Earth were amaz'd at the Tremendous <hi>Viſion</hi> and Noiſe; for the <hi>Mountain</hi> was all on <hi>Fire,</hi> whoſe <hi>Flames</hi> reach'd up to the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and its <hi>Smoke</hi> to the <hi>Mid-Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Globe</hi> Trembled and Quak'd at the Dreadful <hi>Thundrings,</hi> and the <hi>Lightnings</hi> penetrated the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> The <hi>Infernal Spirits</hi> were ſtartled at the <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt, <hi>Nathan,</hi> I am no <hi>Infidel,</hi> but believe, as thou doſt, That the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was brought down from <hi>Heaven.</hi> But does it therefore follow, That this <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and <hi>Eternal?</hi> Can none be <hi>ſav'd</hi> but the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſuch as are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyted to their <hi>Religion?</hi> Doubtleſs this is an Error, as thou thy ſelf wilt acknowledge, when thou haſt well examin'd the Matter. Remove thy Poſt a little, if it be only in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: Riſe from the Feet of thy <hi>Doctors,</hi> who have inſtill'd into thee Prejudices againſt all the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Adam,</hi> except thoſe of your Own <hi>Race.</hi> Stand aloof for a while, and look round about thee to the <hi>Four Winds:</hi> but fix thine Eyes on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> for from thence <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> takes her <hi>Origin.</hi> Did not the ſame <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>Greated</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> alſo <hi>Create</hi> all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the Earth? And canſt thou be ſo blind and obdurate as to think, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty Merciful</hi> made ſo many <hi>Millions</hi> of <hi>Souls</hi> on Purpoſe to <hi>Damn</hi> them? Or that it ſhall be Imputed to them for <hi>Sin,</hi> that they were not born of the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Jacob?</hi> Was it in their Power to chuſe the <hi>Father</hi> that ſhou'd <hi>beget</hi> them, or the <hi>Mother</hi> that ſhou'd <hi>conceive</hi> them? How Abſurd are the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this Narrow Opinion? It is an unpardonable Pride and Malice, thus to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102962:145"/>contemn and Judge thoſe that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the ſame Ingredients as your ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, <hi>God</hi> has ſent <hi>Prophets</hi> into all <hi>Nations,</hi> to guide them into the <hi>Right Way,</hi> and not into the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Infidels.</hi> Thoſe who believe the <hi>Prophets</hi> and obey their <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> ſhall be Sav'd: For they preach the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> the <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Torments</hi> of the <hi>Damn'd.</hi> They teach the Neceſſity of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Purity, and Good Works; exhorting all to practiſe the <hi>Golden Rule,</hi> without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling their Minds in endleſs Niceties, which are but the Superfetation of Piety, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious Burdens of a <hi>Religious</hi> Life.

                  <p>Thy Letter replies to this by Anticipation: For, ſuppoſing that I ſhould argue thus, and charge you with adding <hi>Traditions</hi> of your own, to the <hi>Poſitive Injunctions</hi> of the <hi>Law;</hi> Thou telleſt me, That thoſe are greatly miſtaken, who think that all which was deliver'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Mount,</hi> was Written in the <hi>Two Tables,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd even in the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> as if the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpent thoſe <hi>Forty Days</hi> and <hi>Nights</hi> only in keeping of <hi>Geeſe.</hi> For it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, ſay'ſt thou, That if <hi>God</hi> had No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to give him but the <hi>Written Law,</hi> he might have diſpatch'd him in an <hi>Hour</hi> or a <hi>Day</hi> at Moſt. Therefore thou addeſt, That by <hi>Day</hi> he gave to him the <hi>Written Law,</hi> and by <hi>Night</hi> the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious</hi> Explanation of it, call'd, The <hi>Oral Law:</hi> Which <hi>Explanation, Moſes</hi> taught by <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Mouth</hi> to <hi>Joſhua</hi> his <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, Joſhua</hi> to the <hi>Seventy Two Seniors;</hi> and that they tranſmitted this <hi>Oral Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionary Comment</hi> down to their <hi>Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> even to the Laſt of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> from whom the <hi>Great Sanhedrim</hi> receiv'd it. After this every one deliver'd it to his <hi>Son,</hi> as he had receiv'd it from his <hi>Anceſtors;</hi> and ſo it continues to this Day, to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of your <hi>Lives,</hi> in thoſe Caſes where the <hi>Written Law</hi> is Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. I tell thee <hi>Nathan,</hi> there appears a great Shew of Reaſon in what thou ſayeſt: And indeed it cannot be ſuppos'd, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpent all that Time, only in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102962:146"/>receiving the <hi>Written Law.</hi> But on the other ſide, I cannot believe that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Mind</hi> was buſied ſo many <hi>Days,</hi> in preſcribing thoſe <hi>Ridiculous Rules</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are found in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> and the <hi>Writings</hi> of your <hi>Rabbi's.</hi> If thou canſt convince me of that, I will ceaſe to Perſwade thee to a Change.</p>
                  <p>I have a great deal more to ſay, but the Hour of the <hi>Poſt</hi> calls on me to conclude my Letter. In my next, I will fully anſwer all thy Arguments. In the mean Time, let not <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates</hi> of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> ſupplant thy <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but remember thou art a <hi>Man.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Sublimely Wiſe, <hi>the</hi> Senior <hi>of Excellent Dignity,</hi> Abul-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cowawn', Grand Almoner <hi>to the</hi> Sultan.</head>
                  <p>THou art placed on a High <hi>Seat,</hi> Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent among the <hi>Faithful;</hi> and the Eyes of the Diſtreſs'd, are fix'd on thee. Thou art the <hi>Patron</hi> of all the Miſerable. To thee, as to a <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> flies the Man, whoſe Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes have bereav'd him of all other Hope: Whoſe drooping Spirits can find no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from the Reſt of Mortals. His laſt and only Refuge is to thee, who art the Faithful <hi>Steward</hi> of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Liberalities. Let not too much Prudence ſuperſede thy Charity. The Wicked and the Innocent, have Equal Acceſs to thee: And it ought to be ſo; for, no Man, at firſt, can diſtinguiſh between the One and the Other by their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Aſpect. Yet a little Examination and Converſe, will ſhew the Difference.</p>
                  <p>There are thoſe, who get large Poſſeſſions under the Maſque of Poverty. There are Impudent <hi>Beggars,</hi> who make a Trade of impoſing on Human Compaſſion, and ſport themſelves in this humble Method of cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People of their Money; whilſt, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102962:147"/>they beſtow it on Perſons really Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, it is thrown away on Counterfeits, <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, I have ſeen true Objects of Pity, Men reduc'd to the laſt Extremities, who wou'd rather periſh, than expoſe their Condition to any, ſave the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Noble.</hi> They eſteem ſuch to be Wiſe Men, Generous, and Conſiderate of the Accidents which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly befall Mortals. They think, to theſe they may freely unboſom themſelves, tell their Wants, and claim Relief, without the Hazard of a Reproach, which wounds more deeply than a ſhort Denial.</p>
                  <p>Thou mayſt know them by the Modeſty which appears in their Faces, (ſays our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi>) and that they are ſoon repuls'd. To ſuch as theſe give plentiful <hi>Alms,</hi> and do not repine. For it is as a Profitable <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize,</hi> ſent to Remote Countries; which though ventur'd on the Uncertain Waters, yet in Time by the ſpecial Bleſſing of <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſhall return with Seven-fold Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Nay, give to all that ask: For, it is better to miſplace our <hi>Charity</hi> on Nine Unworthy Perſons, than to deny an <hi>Alms</hi> to One that is really in Need. Beſides, it is not for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a <hi>Sovereign Monarch,</hi> that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Diſtreſs ſhou'd depart from his <hi>Court,</hi> ſad or diſcontented, for Want of Relief.</p>
                  <p>I have in ſome of my Letters, glanc'd at the <hi>Vices</hi> of theſe <hi>Weſtern Nazarenes;</hi> and have not been altogether ſilent as to their <hi>Vertues.</hi> Among which, their <hi>Charity</hi> is very Conſpicuous.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102962:147"/>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> relate a pretty Paſſage of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Cardinal,</hi> a very Good Man, and one that by the Multitude of his Generous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, gave Occaſion for the World to call him, the <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>Poor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Prince,</hi> had a conſtant Cuſtom, Once or Twice a Week, to give Publick Audience to all Indigent People in the <hi>Hall</hi> of his <hi>Palace,</hi> and to relieve every one according to their various Neceſſities, or the Motions of his own Bounty.</p>
                  <p>One Day, a poor Widow encourag'd with the Fame of his Generoſity, came into the <hi>Hall</hi> of this <hi>Cardinal,</hi> with her only Daughter, a beautiful Maid, about Fifteen Years of Age. When her Turn came to be heard, among the Crowd of Petitioners; the <hi>Cardinal</hi> diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marks of an extraordinary Modeſty in her Face and Carriage, as alſo in her Daughter, he encourag'd her to tell her Wants freely. She bluſhing, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tears, thus addreſs'd her ſelf to him; <hi>My Lord, I owe for the Rent of my Houſe Five Crowns, and ſuch is my Misfortune, that I have no other Means to pay it, ſave what wou'd break my Heart, ſince my Landlord threatens to force me to it, that is, to Proſtitute this my only Daughter, whom I have hitherto with great Care Educated in Vertue, and an Abhorrence of that Odious Crime. What I beg of your Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is, That you wou'd pleaſe to interpoſe your Sacred Authority, and protect us from the Violence of this Cruel Man, till by our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Induſtry, we can procure the Money for him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:102962:148"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> mov'd with Admiration of the Woman's Vertue and Innocent Modeſty, bid her be of good Courag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Then he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately wrote a Billet, and giving it into the Widows Hands, <hi>Go,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to my Steward with this Paper, and he ſhall deliver thee Five Crowns to pay thy Rent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poor Woman over-joy'd, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Cardinal</hi> a Thouſand Thanks, went directly to his <hi>Steward,</hi> and gave him the Note: Which when he had read, he told her out Fifty Crowns. She aſtoniſh'd at the Meaning of it, and fearing this was only the <hi>Steward</hi>'s Trick to try her Honeſty, refus'd to take above Five, ſaying, <hi>She ask'd the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal for no more, and ſhe was ſure 'twas ſome Miſtake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Steward</hi> inſiſted on his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Order, not daring to call it in Queſtion. But all the Arguments he cou'd uſe, were inſufficient to prevail on her, to take any more than Five Crowns. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to end the Controverſy, he offer'd to go back with her to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and refer it to him. When they came before that <hi>Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Prince,</hi> and he was fully inform'd of the Buſineſs. <hi>'Tis true,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I miſtook in writing Fifty Crowns. Give me the Paper and I will rectify it.</hi> Thereupon he wrote again; Saying thus to the Woman, <hi>So much Candor and Vertue, deſerves a Recompence. Here I have order'd you Five Hundred Crowns, What you can ſpare of it, lay up as a Dowry to give with your Daughter in Marriage.</hi>

                  <p>If I miſtake not, this <hi>Cardinal</hi> was call'd <hi>Farneſe.</hi> But, whatever his Name was, this was an Action truly Heroick, and which has but few Parallels.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Captain Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>THou that art a Man of <hi>War,</hi> delighteſt, no Doubt, to hear of Combats and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels. And I tell thee, That ſince the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>World,</hi> there have never been known ſuch dreadful <hi>Sea-Fights,</hi> as during the preſent <hi>War</hi> between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> It ſeems, there is an Emulation ſprung up in the Latter: They grudge the Inhabitants of <hi>Britain</hi> the <hi>Character,</hi> which has been given 'em from all <hi>Antiquity, Of being the moſt Victorious on that Element, of any Nation on the Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis poſſible there may be ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Grounds of their preſent <hi>Quarrel,</hi> to which I am a Stranger. But aſſuredly, they have purſu'd their Animoſities very eagerly on both Sides. And, let the Occaſion be what it will, the <hi>Dutch</hi> are ſtill Loſers.</p>
                  <p>I ſent thee an Account of a <hi>Combat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their <hi>Fleets</hi> laſt Year, ſince which they have had many other <hi>Engagements.</hi> And 'tis ſaid here, that during this <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have taken from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> near Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Merchant</hi> Veſſels; have Sunk and Burnt many of their <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> ſlain ſome of their <hi>Chief Commanders,</hi> ſpoil'd their <hi>Trade,</hi> and reduc'd 'em almoſt to as great Streights, as when they firſt courted the Protection of the

                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> againſt their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> from whom they had then newly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt terrible Conflict was, on the Second of this <hi>Moon,</hi> wherein the <hi>Dutch</hi> had Seven and Twenty of their Greateſt Ships, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſunk or burnt, Two Thouſand of their Seamen and Soldiers kill'd, and a Thouſand taken Priſoners, with many Captains. That Great <hi>General Trump,</hi> whom I mention'd in my Laſt, was ſlain in this <hi>Fight,</hi> after he had perform'd Prodigies of Valour.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> ſay, that during the Heat of this Engagement, <hi>Trump</hi> being exceſſive Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, call'd for a Bowl of Wine; which his Servant had no ſooner deliver'd to him, but a Cannon-Bullet took his Hand off, juſt as he was retiring from his <hi>Maſter.</hi> The brave <hi>General</hi> touch'd with a Noble Compaſſion, ſpilt the Wine on the Deck, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>It is not fit that I ſhould quench my Thirſt, with the Blood of a Faithful Slave.</hi> And as ſoon as he had ſpoke theſe Words, another Bullet took from him, the Power of ever drinking again.</p>
                  <p>If ſuch an Accident ſhould happen to thee, when thou fighteſt againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> know for certain, that thou ſhalt be immediately tranſported to the <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Shady Banks</hi> of the <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where thou may'ſt drink thy Fill in Eternal Security.

                  <p>I Remember I promiſed in my Laſt, to give thee a farther account of <hi>Pachicour,</hi> the famous <hi>Pyrate</hi> of the <hi>Black-Sea,</hi> 'Twere ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to perform it, but a Temptation diverts my Pen another Way.</p>
                  <p>I remember when thou wert <hi>Chiaus,</hi> I have heard thee ſpeak of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> whither thou waſt ſent by <hi>Sultan Amurat,</hi> to compoſe the Differences that happen'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Dey</hi> and the <hi>Divan</hi> of that City. At the ſame Time, thou mad'ſt Mention of a certain Admirable <hi>Engine,</hi> contriv'd to draw up <hi>Ships</hi> or any Thing elſe from the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea: And, that the <hi>Divan</hi> of <hi>Tunis,</hi> gave to the <hi>Artiſt</hi> who fram'd it, an Hundred Thouſand <hi>Piaſters,</hi> as a <hi>Reward</hi> of his Ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>I have read in a certain <hi>French Author,</hi> of ſuch another Device at <hi>Venice,</hi> made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to draw up the Famous <hi>Carrack,</hi> which they call'd the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of the <hi>Sea.</hi> This <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> was built of a Monſtrous Bulk, more for State than Service; and was overturn'd by her own Unweildineſs, as ſhe lay at Anchor, and ſunk to the Bottom: From whence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102962:150"/>that foremention'd <hi>Engine,</hi> nor all the Art of Man could raiſe. Yet the Skill of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginier</hi> was highly commended, and the <hi>Senate</hi> honour'd him with the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Clariſſimo,</hi> and ſettled a Noble <hi>Penſion</hi> on him during Life.</p>
                  <p>It is queſtion'd, whether the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will be ſo Liberal to a certain <hi>French En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginier,</hi> who has made a <hi>Ship</hi> at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> which they ſay, will out-do all the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Ark.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Ship</hi> is at preſent all the Talk at <hi>Paris.</hi> Our Merchants receive Letters full of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the <hi>Low-Countreys,</hi> concerning this Whirligig of a Veſſel, which is to move by Clockwork, without Sails, Oars, Rudder, or any Common Marine Tackle; Yet, ſhall cut her Way through the Sea, with a ſwifter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs than the <hi>Moon</hi> glides along the <hi>Sky,</hi> or a <hi>Bullet</hi> out of a <hi>Cannon.</hi> This is the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of thoſe who love to advance all that they hear, to the Height of a <hi>Miracle</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi> Yet 'tis certain, the <hi>Artiſt</hi> has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, it ſhall equal the Motion of ſome Birds, and run Twelve Leagues an Hour. Neither Winds nor Tides ſhall forward or hinder its Courſe, which depending on an Internal Principle of <hi>Perpetual Motion,</hi> is to be directed only at the Pleaſure of him who manages the Springs and Wheels. So that the <hi>Maſter</hi> of this <hi>Veſſel,</hi> ſhall be able with a ſingle touch of Hand, to turn it to any <hi>Point</hi> of the <hi>Compaſs,</hi> in the moſt Boiſterous Weather that blows.</p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:102962:151"/>
                  <p>This <hi>Enginier</hi> farther engages, that his <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> ſhall make a Voyage to the <hi>Eaſt-Inaies</hi> in the <hi>Revolution</hi> of a <hi>Moon,</hi> and to ſome <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> in a fourth Part of that Time. If he be as good at Performance, as he is at Promiſing, he will Sail round the <hi>Globe,</hi> at this Rate, in Three <hi>Moons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In farther Commendation of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Machine,</hi> 'tis ſaid, That by a New-Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Art, it ſhall ſecretly under-Water diſable any Ship, provided ſhe be within Cannon-Shot; and this with ſo ſudden a force, that in the Space of Six Hours, it will ſucceſſively ſink a Fleet of a Hundred Ships of <hi>War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, this <hi>Artiſt,</hi> to appear not leſs ſubtle againſt the <hi>Efforts</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> than in ſurpaſſing all the <hi>Inventions</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that his Miraculous <hi>Veſſel,</hi> ſhall at the Diſtance of a League, cut aſunder any <hi>Spouts</hi> or <hi>Cataracts</hi> of Waters, which uſually threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Mariners</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seas.</p>
                  <p>'Tis poſſible thou art very well acquainted with the Nature of theſe <hi>Spouts,</hi> and the Danger of Ships that Sail near them. Yet give me Leave to inform thee, what I have heard from a certain <hi>Corſair,</hi> who has often met with 'em in the <hi>Levant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Pyrate</hi> tells me, that a <hi>Spout</hi> is a kind of <hi>Aqueduct</hi> between the Clouds and the Sea, by which thoſe Pendulous Cyſterns <hi>Above,</hi> are repleniſh'd with Water from the <hi>Ocean,</hi> drawing it up, as through a Pipe; Which ſeems to be let down for that End, at certain
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:102962:151"/>Seaſons, and in ſome Particular Places, where the Water boyls up firſt above the Surface of the Briny Plain, as a Signal to thoſe Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Bladders, to make a Deſcent there and ſuck their fill.</p>
                  <p>If this be true, who knows but that all the Rain, to which the Earth is indebted for its Fertility, comes thus Originally from the Sea? For, it may be made freſh, either in its firſt Aſcent through the Roſcid Air, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter its Reception into the Clouds, by ſome hidden <hi>Energy</hi> of that <hi>Element,</hi> or the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Force of the <hi>Middle Region:</hi> Or at leaſt by ſome Unknown Vertue, perhaps not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that by which the Waters of a <hi>Bitter Lake</hi> in the <hi>Deſert,</hi> became <hi>Sweet</hi> at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of our <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> when the whole Army of the Primitive <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> was like to have periſh'd of Thirſt.</p>
                  <p>And then how will the <hi>Weſtern Philoſophers</hi> diſpoſe of all the Vapours, which they ſay are Exhal'd from this <hi>Globe,</hi> and afterwards Condens'd into Clouds? I tell thee, that's but a Looſe Notion of ſuch Retentive Bodies, as the Clouds ſeem to be. And 'twou'd tempt one to ask, What the Veſſels are made of which hold thoſe Condens'd Exhalations, ſo that they do not fall at once upon our Heads and overwhelm us, but only deſtil in ſmall ſucceſſive Showers Drop by Drop, to refreſh the Barren Parts of the Earth, and ſerve the Neceſſities of Men? And why the Rains fall in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and other <hi>Regions</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> whole <hi>Moons</hi> together without Intermiſſion,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102962:152"/>the Reſt of the Year being dry: Whereas, in other Countries, the Periods of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Alteration are uncertain, and in ſome Parts, it ſeldom or never rains at all?</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> are Inſcrutable: And tho' it may be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a great Wit, to give Ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for many Wonderful <hi>Appearances</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> yet 'tis an Evidence of ſmall Piety or Judgment, to be poſitive in any Thing, but the Acknowledgment of our own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>Now I have made as Wide an Excurſion from my firſt Diſcourſe, as the <hi>Moulia</hi> did, who began an <hi>Oration</hi> in Praiſe of <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Ark,</hi> and ended with telling a Tale of an <hi>Armenian Wheel-Barrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I will not forget, that I was ſpeaking of the Promiſe which the <hi>Rotterdam Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier</hi> has made of his <hi>Machine,</hi> That it ſhou'd Effectually break all the Force of <hi>Spouts,</hi> which wou'd render him very Serviceable to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> as a <hi>Convoy</hi> to defend them from thoſe Terrible Bug bears to Sailers. For the <hi>Corſair</hi> tells me, that theſe <hi>Spouts</hi> very often occaſion Ship-wrecks; either by entangling the Maſts of a Ship, and ſo overturning it; or, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Encounter, overwhelm it with water, and ſo ſink it.</p>
                  <p>He ſays likewiſe, that the <hi>Chriſtian Pyrates</hi> are accuſtom'd to uſe a certain <hi>Charm</hi> againſt theſe <hi>Spouts.</hi> They have a <hi>Knife,</hi> whoſe Haft is made of the Bone of a Man's Right Arm: And every <hi>Veſſel,</hi> is bound to provide One or
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102962:152"/>Two of theſe <hi>Knives,</hi> when they looſe from the Shore. They buy 'em of certain Perſons, who have the Character of <hi>Magicians.</hi> And when they ſee a <hi>Spout</hi> at ſome Diſtance from 'em at Sea, the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Veſſel</hi> or any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, takes this <hi>Enchanted Knife</hi> in his <hi>Right</hi> Hand, and holding the <hi>Book</hi> of their <hi>Goſpel</hi> in his <hi>Left,</hi> reads ſome Part of it; And when he comes to a certain <hi>Verſicle,</hi> which menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he makes a Motion with his <hi>Knife</hi> towards the <hi>Spout,</hi> as if he wou'd cut it in Two. Whereupon, immediately the <hi>Spout</hi> breaks in the Middle; and all the inclos'd Water falls into the Sea.</p>
                  <p>But I tell thee, he who gives Credit to the Stories of <hi>Charms,</hi> or the Projects of Men pretending to excell all the Reſt of their Race; has more <hi>Faith,</hi> than is requiſite to him who reads <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s <hi>Fables,</hi> ſince in peruſing that Ingenious <hi>Figment,</hi> we are only deſired to believe the <hi>MORAL.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis thought by ſome, That this <hi>Enginier</hi> will, by the Natural Clockwork of his Heels, be much more nimble than his Veſſel, in flying the Diſgrace which will attend him, if his Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick Project prove unſucceſsful.

                  <p>THE <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> one wou'd think, were ſtudying how to perplex their <hi>Adorers.</hi> Theſe <hi>Weſtern Parts,</hi> abound with <hi>Prodigies,</hi> and Surprizing Events.

                  </p>
                  <p>For ſeveral Weeks we have been alarm'd from thence, with the <hi>Tragical</hi> Stories of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102962:154"/>Ship-wrecks, Inundations, Tempeſts of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning, not uſual at this Time of Year; Monſtrous <hi>Spectres</hi> ſeen riſing out of the Seas, Lakes and Rivers; <hi>Armies</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> with <hi>Comets</hi> and other <hi>Wonderful Apparitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>States</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> have loſt by Wreck Sixteen <hi>Ships</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> and Thirty Seven <hi>Merchant Veſſels.</hi> It looks, as if <hi>Aeolus</hi> and <hi>Neptune,</hi> the Chief <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> had enter'd into a <hi>League,</hi> to puniſh 'em for ſtruggling againſt their <hi>Fate;</hi> whilſt they maintain a <hi>Fleet</hi> to brave and plunder the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under whoſe Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow they firſt roſe to the Power they ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully now poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>For, beſides theſe Loſſes at Sea, the Winds and Waves have conſpir'd to break down their very <hi>Banks,</hi> the onely Guards they have againſt that <hi>Encroaching Element.</hi> All the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> are overwhelm'd with Water: Inſomuch, as Five Miles within Land from <hi>Oſtend,</hi> there has been found a <hi>Whale</hi> newly caſt up, Seven Times as long as a Man.</p>
                  <p>This the <hi>Infidels</hi> look on as a <hi>Great Prodigy,</hi> and the <hi>Fore-runner</hi> of ſome Strange <hi>Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> Though it is but a <hi>Natural</hi> Event, and frequently happens in thoſe Seas, where <hi>Whales</hi> are more plentiful. The <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> ſay, That this <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Scaly Nations,</hi> never makes his Progreſs through the Seas without his <hi>Guide;</hi> which is a certain ſmall Fiſh, that always ſwims before him, and gives him Warning of Flats and Shallows, upon which he often ſtrikes, and ſometimes on the main
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:102962:155"/>Shores, if his little <hi>Guide</hi> chance to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by any other Fiſh, or come to other Mishap. And this may be the Reaſon, why ſo many <hi>Whales</hi> are found on the Sands when the Tide Ebbs. They ſay alſo, That when this little Fiſh is inclin'd to Reſt, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into the <hi>Whale</hi>'s Belly, repoſing it ſelf there for ſome Time; during which the <hi>Whale</hi> reſts alſo, not daring to venture forward, till his <hi>Guide</hi> comes forth and leads the Way. If this be true, it ſeems as if there were a League or Friendſhip contracted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe Two, they Mutually perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the neceſſary Offices of Love and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And how this can be done without ſome <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> I cannot comprehend.</p>
                  <p>Let them at the <hi>Port</hi> call me <hi>Myneſih,</hi> or what they pleaſe, I cannot forbear doing this Juſtice to the <hi>Fiſh</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Animals</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> to acknowledge, That either they are indu'd with a <hi>Kind</hi> of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> or, that <hi>Faculty</hi> which we call ſo in Men, is no other than <hi>Sence.</hi> If the <hi>Brutes</hi> perform many Things without any Deliberation or Counſel, ſo do moſt Men: And no Man can demonſtrate, That even thoſe <hi>Dumb Beings,</hi> do not adviſe and project, before they attempt any Thing of Moment towards their own Preſervation, or the Service of others. And if they ſeem to do many Things raſhly, it may be attributed to the Quickneſs and Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their <hi>Sence,</hi> which needs not the Slow and Flegmatick Methods of <hi>Human</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> t'other Day as he was a-hunting, diſcharg'd a Fowling-Piece at a <hi>Partridge</hi> on the Wing.

                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Portugal</hi> has an <hi>Embaſſador</hi> here, who in his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Name propoſes a <hi>Match</hi> between this <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> proffering Four Millions of Crowns as her <hi>Dowry.</hi> But the <hi>Court</hi> entertains this Motion coldly; the <hi>Cardinal</hi> being averſe, for what Reaſon is not known: For the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi> has an Illuſtrious Character, and known to be a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of Incomparable Vertue.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Friends and Well-Wiſhers, ſmile at his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Death; knowing, that if no Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Stroke of <hi>Fate</hi> carry him out of the World, he will be at the Head of a Potent Army in the <hi>Spring,</hi> to put many to Death in Reality, and by the Edge of the Sword, who fight for his Enemies.</p>

                  <p>Here has been great Rejoicings lately for the taking of St. <hi>Menehoud,</hi> a Strong <hi>Town</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi> All the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>French King</hi>'s Army, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to diſſuade him from the Siege of this <hi>Place;</hi> but <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> over-rul'd their Arguments, and having reprov'd their groundleſs Fears, caus'd it to be inveſted and attacqu'd the 22d. of the 10th. <hi>Moon.</hi> Some ſay, he had a Party there.

                  </p>
                  <p>They were receiv'd with great Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſeeming Joy, by thoſe who wou'd have triumph'd more heartily, had they been defeated, or forc'd to raiſe the Siege. For the Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> wiſh well to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Arms: Not ſo much out of Love to him, as in Hatred of his Enemy, the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Miniſter.</hi> And they are ſenſible, that this Succeſsful Siege, will redound wholly to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102962:158"/>the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Honour, by whoſe ſole Orders the <hi>Place</hi> was inveſted.</p>
                  <p>It is diſcours'd, as if this <hi>Miniſter</hi> has ſome new Deſign on Foot, to conquer the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Naples.</hi> This is certain, a Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Fleet</hi> is fitting out to Sea: Whither bound, no Man knows, but thoſe of the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> among whom the <hi>Cardinal</hi> is Chief.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, the Common People liſten after certain <hi>Prodigies,</hi> that have been ſeen in the Air.

                  <p>Here are divers of his <hi>Subjects</hi> in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and other <hi>Engliſh, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who embrace the Intereſt of <hi>Charles,</hi> the Son of their late Murder'd <hi>King,</hi> who has been ſince Crown'd <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Scots.</hi> They give a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Character of <hi>Oliver;</hi> yet all agree, that he is a <hi>Wiſe Stateſman,</hi> and a <hi>Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scotch King</hi>'s Party, ſpeak contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Birth and Education: Yet
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102962:158"/>thou know'ſt, this hinders not, but he may be a Man of Courage and Vertue. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late many odd Paſſages of his <hi>Youth,</hi> which ſeem to me ſo many Evidences of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Genius,</hi> and that he is a Perſon of a deep Reach.</p>
                  <p>He tamper'd with ſeveral <hi>Religious Factions</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> counterfeiting an Exquiſite <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;</hi> whereby he firſt rais'd himſelf a Name among the <hi>Zealots</hi> of that <hi>Nation,</hi> who look'd upon him there, as a very <hi>Holy</hi> Perſon, and one mark'd out by <hi>Deſtiny</hi> for Great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</p>
                  <p>He ſoon got a Conſiderable <hi>Command,</hi> in the Army of the <hi>Revolters:</hi> Where he ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd himſelf by many brave Actions, which ſpoke him a Man of an Invincible Courage, and Admirable Conduct. So that at Length, none was thought more fit than he to be <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi> In fine, he acquitted himſelf ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly in that <hi>High Office,</hi> and has ſo wrought himſelf into the Affections of the People, that they now look upon him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;</hi> and the <hi>Divan</hi> or <hi>Parliament</hi> of that <hi>Nation,</hi> have conferr'd on him the <hi>Sovereign Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> which are Affected to his Intereſt, ſpeak Great Things in his Praiſe; They call him another <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Joſhua:</hi> They prefer him to <hi>Hannibal, Scipio,</hi> and even to the <hi>Great Alexander.</hi> It is difficult for them, to ſpeak of him without <hi>Hyperbole's.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> will court his Friendſhip. Indeed, all the Neighbouring Countries,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:102962:159"/>ſtand in Awe of this ſucceſsful <hi>Hero.</hi> And the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who are the only People that durſt engage in a <hi>War</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth,</hi> now ſeek for <hi>Peace,</hi> ſince he is inveſted with the <hi>Supreme Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, the Poor <hi>Exil'd King</hi> of the <hi>Scots,</hi> takes <hi>Sanctuary</hi> in this <hi>Court,</hi> with his Mother the Late <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and his Brother, whom they call the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York.</hi> The <hi>French King</hi> allows them all very Conſiderable <hi>Penſions.</hi> And the Latter has ſome <hi>Command</hi> in the <hi>Army</hi> in <hi>Flanders.</hi> There is another Brother alſo; but, little talk'd of as yet, being the Youngeſt of the Three.</p>
                  <p>They are Generouſly entertain'd here, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peculiar Honour of this <hi>Court,</hi> to be a Hoſpitable <hi>Refuge</hi> to <hi>Princes</hi> in Diſtreſs.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> (of whom thou wilt hear in the <hi>Divan</hi>) is juſt come into my Chamber, and brings me Word, that there is an <hi>Expreſs</hi> newly arriv'd, who informs the <hi>Queen</hi> of a Defeat given to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> near a City call'd <hi>Rozes,</hi> which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd in <hi>Catalonia.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> were going to the Relief of this <hi>Place,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſet upon them in their March, but were
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:102962:159"/>beaten into their Trenches; from whence they fled by Night, leaving Three Hundred <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> on the Spot, almoſt Two Thouſand Priſoners, and all their Cannon and Baggage.</p>
                  <p>This has put the <hi>Court</hi> into a Jolly Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.

                  <p>WHEN I firſt open'd thy Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Letter, my Heart on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den became freſh as a Garden of Roſes, or a Field of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Myrrh, whoſe Odours are Exhal'd by the <hi>Weſt</hi>-Wind. In my Breaſt there ſprung
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102962:161"/>up a Fountain of Joy, ſerene as Cryſtal, and refreſhing as the Waters of <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I contemplate thee as a <hi>Cedar</hi> among the Trees of the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> or as the Durable <hi>Oak</hi> of the <hi>Deſart.</hi> May <hi>Heaven</hi> prolong thy Life, till the <hi>Sound</hi> of the <hi>Trumpet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Commands with which thou haſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd me, came in an Acceptable Hour. I have receiv'd them with a Complacency which I cannot expreſs. My Eyes were ſo fix'd on the Lines of Great Purity, that I could not for a long Time take them off. Thou haſt hit the Mark of my Affection, in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying me to write what the moſt Impartial <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> ſay of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Holy Prophet,</hi> was Honour'd by his very Enemies. <hi>Joſephus</hi> a Learned <hi>Jew,</hi> who liv'd in his Time, and wrote the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of that <hi>Nation,</hi> makes worthy Mention of him.</p>
                  <p>So did many of the <hi>Gentile Philoſophers,</hi> though they oppos'd his <hi>Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Porphyry,</hi> whom the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> commonly repute as a bitter Enemy to their <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> yet calls <hi>Jeſus, Wiſe, Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> That <hi>Sage,</hi> was exaſperated againſt a certain <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Nazarenes</hi> in his Time, whom they call'd <hi>Gnoſticks.</hi> Theſe corrupted the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and the <hi>Theology</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients;</hi> wantonly mixing <hi>Humane</hi> Fables with <hi>Divine</hi> Truths. Againſt theſe, <hi>Porphyry</hi> ſharpen'd his Pen, and not making a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them and other <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:102962:161"/>drew upon himſelf the Ill-Will of them all. Yet he retain'd a Profound Attach for the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wouldſt thou know the Circumſtances of this <hi>Holy Prophet</hi>'s Birth? They were Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even in Obſcurity. For, though his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother were then upon the Road to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Strangers at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and forc'd for want of Room in the <hi>Carvanſera,</hi> to lodge in a Stable with an Ox and an Aſs, where the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was born, and laid in a Manger; Yet in this Contemptible State, there came ſome of the <hi>Magi</hi> out of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> who brought <hi>Preſents</hi> to the <hi>Holy Infant;</hi> And having laid at his Feet Gold, Myrrh and Incenſe, they proſtrated themſelves on the Ground, and praiſed <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Moſt High King</hi> of <hi>All,</hi> in that he had honour'd them with a Sight of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was in the 43d Year of the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> the <hi>Roman Emperor.</hi> At which Time, one <hi>Herod</hi> was <hi>Preſident</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea.</hi> This Man being inform'd, That certain <hi>Noble Strangers</hi> were come out of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſent for them, and enquiring the Occaſion of ſo tedious a Journey, they gave him this Anſwer.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Peace be to thee, O <hi>Sultan;</hi> There was of Old Time a <hi>Prophet</hi> of Great Fame in our <hi>Nation,</hi> who, among other <hi>Predictions</hi> that have ſince come to paſs, left alſo this in Writing:</p>
                     <p>That in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> ſhould be born a <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Heavenly Race,</hi> who ſhould Rule over
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102962:162"/>the Greateſt Part of the World. And by this Sign, Ye ſhall know the Time and Place of his Birth: A ſtrange <hi>Star</hi> ſhall appear in the <hi>Firmament,</hi> which ſhall direct you to the very Houſe where you may find him. When therefore Ye ſhall behold this <hi>Star,</hi> take Gold, Myrrh and Incenſs; and following the Conduct of the <hi>Star,</hi> go and offer theſe Gifts to the Young <hi>Child;</hi> Then return immediately to your Own Country, leſt ſome Grievous Calamity befal you.</p>
                     <p>Now this <hi>Star</hi> has appeared to us, We are come to perform what was commanded Us.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Herod</hi> ſaid to them, <hi>Ye have done well. Go therefore and ſeek diligently for the</hi> Infant; <hi>and when Ye have found him, come and tell me, that I may go and pay him Homage alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they never return'd to him again. Wherefore, <hi>Herod</hi> in his Anger and Jealouſie, commanded all the <hi>Infants</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to be Strangl'd, that had not been Born above Four and Twenty <hi>Moons.</hi> But the Father and the Mother of the <hi>Holy Infant,</hi> fled away with him into the <hi>Land</hi> where it never Rains, the ſame Night that the <hi>Magi</hi> came.</p>
                  <p>What I here relate to thee, Sage <hi>Bedredin,</hi> is taken out of approv'd <hi>Hiſtorians:</hi> For, many among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wrote of theſe Things beſides the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a <hi>Roman Philoſopher,</hi> much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame Time; a Man in great Eſteem with <hi>Caeſar.</hi> To whom he wrote a Letter, wherein he mentions the coming of the <hi>Magi</hi>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:102962:162"/>after this manner. <q>Certain Oriental <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> ſays he, have ſet Foot within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of thy <hi>Empire,</hi> bringing <hi>Preſents</hi> fit only for <hi>Kings,</hi> to a certain Child, newly born in the <hi>Country</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But who this <hi>Infant</hi> is, or whoſe Son, VVe are yet Ignorant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou ſeeſt, O Pious <hi>Dervich,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> appear'd with no ſmall Luſtre, even in his <hi>Cradle.</hi> And in his Early Years, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into the <hi>Temple,</hi> and diſputed with the <hi>Hebrew Rabbi's,</hi> convincing them of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Defection from the <hi>Primitive Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes;</hi> declaring himſelf the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and yet in Profound Humility acknowledging, That a <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould come after him, who ſhould be preferred before him, the Duſt of whoſe Feet he was not worthy to kiſs. This Paſſage the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have perverted to another Senſe; but the <hi>True Faithful,</hi> know it was ſpoken only of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the <hi>SEAL</hi> of the <hi>PROPHETS.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Time would fail me, to recount all the Stupendous Actions of this <hi>Man's</hi> Life: And in calling him <hi>MAN,</hi> I imitate his own Example; Since throughout the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> he never call'd himſelf <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do, but moſt frequently gave himſelf the <hi>Title,</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi> He turn'd Water into Wine, fed Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand People with Five Cakes and Two ſmall <hi>Tenches:</hi> Heal'd all Diſeaſes, reſtor'd Sight to them that were born Blind, Rais'd the <hi>Dead,</hi> went Inviſible through Crowds of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102962:163"/>and Finally, was taken up into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wouldſt know more of this <hi>Holy Prophet;</hi> There are <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> who ſay, he was Initiated in the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> a certain <hi>Sect</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Nation,</hi> it ſeems, was then divided into Seven <hi>Claſſes.</hi> Among which, this of the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> was none of the leaſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as being the moſt <hi>Religious</hi> Obſervers of the <hi>Law.</hi> Their Converſation was full of Humanity, both among themſelves, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Strangers: Avoiding Pleaſures, as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Mind, and eſteeming Chaſtity the very Cement of all Virtues. Therefore they deſpis'd Marriage, as an Entanglement to Men devoted to Contemplation. They had alſo an Equal Contempt for Riches. No Man of this <hi>Sect</hi> call'd any Thing his Own, though 'twere his Lawful Inheritance: But their Poſſeſſions were in Common, and Equally diſtributed.</p>
                  <p>It was among their <hi>Myſteries,</hi> to Anoint their Bodies frequently with Oyl, and as often to waſh 'em with Running Water. They neither bought, nor ſold; nor frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Publick</hi> Places: But every one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated freely ſuch Things as he poſſeſs'd, to him that ſtood in Need. Thus there was a Reciprocal Exchange of Kindneſſes and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, according to every ones Faculty and Power. They were very Aſſiduous in Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Faſting and Prayer: Curious in obſerving the Various Names of the <hi>Angels,</hi> which they
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102962:163"/>frequently repeated, Invocating thoſe <hi>Happy Beings,</hi> as the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>King Eternal.</hi> And thoſe who were exercis'd in this Kind of <hi>Religious</hi> Life, arriv'd to ſo great a Conſtancy of Mind, that neither Racks, Fire, Sword, or any other Tortures could ever move 'em to Renounce their <hi>Law,</hi> or ſpeak the leaſt Word in Contempt of their <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> Nay, they would rather ſuffer <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> than be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on to taſte of any Thing that had <hi>Life</hi> in it. For they were ſtrict Obſervers of the <hi>Law,</hi> which commands Perpetual Abſtinence from the <hi>Fleſh</hi> of <hi>Animals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was an Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Article</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> That as ſoon as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> was diſſolv'd by <hi>Death,</hi> the Former by a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Inclination aſcends to the Skies; even as Sparks flie Upward, when freed from the Groſs Earthy Matter in which they lay Impriſon'd.</p>
                  <p>I have here given thee a ſhort and true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Eſſenes.</hi> Of which <hi>Sect,</hi> all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> own the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to be a <hi>Favourer,</hi> if not a <hi>Member;</hi> in Regard he no where is Recorded to have upbraided them, as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did the <hi>Phariſees, Sadduces, Herodians</hi> and the Reſt.</p>
                  <p>Time will not permit me to ſay more at Preſent, concerning that <hi>Venerable Prophet.</hi> But if thou would'ſt have a Perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of all his Vertues and Sanctity of Life turn thy Eyes Inward, and fix 'em on thy ſelf. For thou art a Lively <hi>Tranſcript</hi> of the <hi>Holy Jeſus.</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Venerable Mufti.</head>
                  <p>THOU haſt heard of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> an <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Nazarene Derviſes.</hi> All <hi>Europe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with them; and they have attempted to ſettle themſelves at the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> and ſeveral Places of <hi>Aſia:</hi> Beſides their Actual Poſſeſſions in the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they are very Numerous and Powerful.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Religious</hi> Perſons, have lately ſpread about a <hi>Letter</hi> in Print, which they pretend comes from one of their <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>Armenia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Diſpatch</hi> relates a Strange Accident, that has happen'd at the <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet</hi> (upon whom reſt the <hi>Favours</hi> of the <hi>Eternal.</hi>) For it affirms, that in the Eighth <hi>Moon</hi> of the laſt Year, the <hi>Shrine</hi> which contains the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly Miſſioner,</hi> fell from the Roof of the Sacred <hi>Moſque</hi> (to which, they ſay, it adher'd by Vertue of a <hi>Magnet,</hi> faſten'd in the <hi>Cantrel</hi> of the <hi>Arch;</hi>) And that at the ſame Time, the <hi>Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> open'd, and ſwallow'd up

                     </gap>in were Repoſited the moſt <hi>Holy Reliques</hi> in the World. And that from the <hi>Chaſme,</hi> there iſſu'd out a Flame, like that of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> accompany'd with ſuch a Smoak and Intolerable Stench, as caus'd all the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> that were preſent to ſwoon away. Whereupon, many of them are ſince turn'd <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Forgery is believ'd here by thoſe, who never examine any Thing their <hi>Prieſts</hi> tell 'em, but take all on Truſt. The Common People bleſs themſelves, in that they were born of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents, and not of the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of that Wicked <hi>Impoſtor:</hi> So they blaſpheme the <hi>Man,</hi> in whom the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of their <hi>Meſſias</hi> are verify'd, when he ſaid, <hi>He wou'd Intercede with</hi> God <hi>to ſend a</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>who ſhou'd lead 'em into all Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They wou'd never be at the Pains or Coſt to examine, whether the Foundation of this Story be true or falſe. All the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> who have been at that <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> know, That the <hi>Body</hi> of our <hi>Divine Lawgiver</hi> repoſes in a <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> built after the ſame Manner as the <hi>Tombs</hi> of our <hi>Auguſt Emperours,</hi> and other <hi>Dormitories</hi> of the <hi>Great:</hi> Only with this Difference, That it ſurpaſſes all the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the World, in the Invaluable Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Ornaments, the Gifts of devout <hi>Muſſulman Princes.</hi> There appears always, ſuch an Inſupportable Luſtre of Gold and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, in every Angle of that Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Receſs, as may well dazle the Eyes of <hi>Mortal</hi> Spectators; ſince the <hi>Angels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

                  <p>SINCE what I wrote laſt in behalf of the <hi>Brute Animals</hi> is ſo Acceptable to thee, I will comply with thy Requeſt, in continuing that Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>'Tis certain the <hi>Ancients</hi> had another Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Beaſts,</hi> than theſe <hi>French Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> who deny 'em the Uſe of <hi>Reaſon. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> us'd to ſwear by the <hi>Animal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> before him. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> Form'd the <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Gods,</hi> in the Similitude of <hi>Beaſts.</hi> or <hi>Birds,</hi> or <hi>Fiſhes.</hi> So the <hi>Grecians</hi> fix'd the <hi>Horns</hi> of a <hi>Ram</hi> on the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s <hi>Statue,</hi> and thoſe of a <hi>Bull</hi> on the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> They compounded the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Pan</hi> of a <hi>Man</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:102962:166"/>and a <hi>Goat,</hi> and painted the <hi>Muſes</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> with <hi>Wings:</hi> And the <hi>Poet Pindar</hi> makes all the <hi>Gods</hi> Winged, and diſguiſes them in the Shapes of ſeveral <hi>Beaſts,</hi> when in his <hi>Hymns</hi> he introduces them chas'd by <hi>Tryphon.</hi> Thou knoweſt alſo, That our <hi>Holy Doctors</hi> affirm the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> to have Wings, with One of which he once gave a Mark to the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Poets</hi> bring in <hi>Jupiter</hi> courting <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> he appears in the Form of a <hi>Bull.</hi> And in his other <hi>Amours,</hi> if we may believe them, he chang'd himſelf ſometimes into a <hi>Swan,</hi> then into an <hi>Eagle.</hi> They report alſo, That he was ſuckl'd by a <hi>Goat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For theſe and other Reaſons, the <hi>Ancients</hi> not only forbore to injure their <hi>Fellow-Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,</hi> but entertain'd them with ſingular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Friendſhip. A <hi>Dove</hi> was the Darling of <hi>Semiramis.</hi> A <hi>Dog</hi> was the Joy of <hi>Cyrus. Philip, King</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> made a <hi>Swan</hi> his Companion. And our <hi>Holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> was often wont to ſport himſelf with a <hi>Cat.</hi> He lov'd this <hi>Creature,</hi> for its Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſs and Activity; and therefore we <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> generally have a <hi>Cat</hi> in great Eſteem and Veneration.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Favourite</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> underſtood the <hi>Languages</hi> of <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and convers'd as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with them as with Men. So it is fam'd of <hi>Melampus</hi> and <hi>Tyreſias</hi> of Old, as alſo of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> who affirm'd to his Friend ſitting by him, that a <hi>Sparrow</hi> which he heard chirping to his Fellows, told them of an <hi>Aſs</hi> which he had ſeen fall down
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102962:166"/>with his Load, a little Way off from that Place. It is alſo recorded of a Boy, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all the <hi>Voices</hi> of <hi>Birds,</hi> and by that Means could foretel Things to come, That his Mother, by pouring Urine into his Ears when he was aſleep, deprived him of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Gift, for Fear he ſhould be taken from her, and preſented to the <hi>King.</hi> There is no Queſtion, but ſeveral <hi>Nations</hi> have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowldge of the <hi>Speech</hi> of ſome <hi>Animals.</hi> My <hi>Countrymen,</hi> by a Peculiar Gift beſtow'd on our <hi>Fathers</hi> and their <hi>Poſterity</hi> for ever, underſtand the <hi>Language</hi> of <hi>Crows</hi> and <hi>Eagles.</hi> And the <hi>Ancients</hi> were ſo well vers'd in this <hi>Knowledge,</hi> that when they convers'd with the <hi>Birds,</hi> or at leaſt when they heard them in their <hi>Language</hi> utter <hi>Preſages</hi> of what ſhou'd ſhortly happen on <hi>Earth,</hi> they perſwaded themſelves, that thoſe <hi>Birds</hi> were the <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of the <hi>Gods.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Eagle</hi> was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>Crow</hi> and <hi>Hawk</hi> of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the <hi>Stork</hi> of <hi>Juno,</hi> the <hi>Owl</hi> of <hi>Minerva,</hi> and ſo of others.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that our Common <hi>Huntſmen</hi> underſtand the Different <hi>Voices</hi> of their <hi>Dogs,</hi> when at a Diſtance they ſignifie by <hi>One</hi> Kind of <hi>Cry,</hi> that they are queſting after the Hare; by <hi>Another,</hi> that they have found her; by a <hi>Third,</hi> that they have taken her, or that ſhe is turn'd to the <hi>Right</hi> Hand or to the <hi>Left.</hi> So thoſe who look after Cattel, know by the <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>Bull,</hi> when he is Hungry, Thirſty or Weary, or when he is ſtung with Luſt. So by the <hi>Roaring</hi> of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>Howling</hi> of,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102962:167"/>
                     <hi>Wolves,</hi> the <hi>Baaing</hi> of <hi>Sheep,</hi> Men are made ſenſible of the various Wants, Inclinations and Paſſions of thoſe Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Nor are theſe <hi>Animals</hi> Ignorant of our <hi>Language,</hi> but by our Voice and Words they know when we are angry or pleas'd, when we call them to us, or drive them from us: And our <hi>Domeſtick</hi> Animals obey accordingly, with as much Promptneſs and Alacrity, as a Man or Maid-Servant. All which cou'd not be, if they were not endu'd with <hi>Faculties</hi> conformable to ours. They alſo teach their Young ones, to ſing Artificially. In a Litter of <hi>Dogs, Huntſmen</hi> chuſe the Beſt by this Experiment. They take all the <hi>Whelps</hi> from the <hi>Bitch,</hi> and carry them to ſome Place a little diſtant; Then they obſerve, which ſhe firſt carries back again, and thoſe always prove the Beſt <hi>Dogs.</hi> What is this <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Faculty</hi> in the <hi>Bitch,</hi> but <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or ſomething like it?</p>
                  <p>We ſee apparently, that every <hi>Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> knows its own Weakneſs or Strength, and knows how to uſe moſt dextrouſly thoſe <hi>Weapons</hi> with which <hi>Nature</hi> has furniſh'd it for its <hi>Own Defence.</hi> They are alſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what Places are moſt Convenient for them to dwell in, and which not. Thus the <hi>Weakeſt</hi> Creatures, as <hi>Dogs</hi> and <hi>Cats,</hi> live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in <hi>Houſes</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> with Men: Whilſt the <hi>Lyons, Tygers</hi> and ſuch <hi>Fierce</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, dwell in the <hi>Deſert.</hi> Thus <hi>Sparrows</hi> and <hi>Swallows</hi> make themſelves almoſt <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks</hi> with Men, whilſt <hi>Eagles, Hawks,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102962:167"/>Vultures</hi> and other <hi>Birds</hi> of <hi>Prey,</hi> build their Neſts in Woods or Rocks, remote from <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Society.

The ſame is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in <hi>Fiſhes.</hi> And in all <hi>Living Creatures,</hi> it is eaſie to trace the Footſteps of Prudence and Forecaſt, in order to their Own Preſervation. Let Men call this what they Pleaſe, <hi>Inſtinct</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Sence;</hi> it is evident, that there is an Exact Conformity and Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe <hi>Faculties</hi> in <hi>Brutes,</hi> and what we call <hi>Reaſon, Wiſdom</hi> or <hi>Prudence</hi> in <hi>Men.</hi> And we have no more Ground to conclude them void of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> becauſe they do not enjoy it in that Perfection as our ſelves; than we have to conclude our ſelves <hi>blind</hi> or <hi>deaf,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we <hi>ſee</hi> not ſo <hi>clearly,</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> not ſo <hi>readily</hi> as the <hi>Brutes:</hi> And, that we have no <hi>Legs,</hi> becauſe we run not ſo <hi>ſwiftly</hi> as <hi>ſome</hi> of them do.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, the <hi>Brutes</hi> are endu'd with a <hi>Faculty</hi> of <hi>Reaſon</hi> as well as we; but this <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> in them, is Weak and Imperfect for want of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Art,</hi> which poliſh all things. This is manifeſt, from thoſe <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> which are Taught to dance, and play a Thouſand Tricks; to tell Money, to ſhoot off Guns, to find out hidden Things, and bring them ſome Miles to their <hi>Maſters,</hi> as well Educated <hi>Spaniels</hi> will do. What can be a greater Argument, of the Proficiency they make in <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Knowledge?</hi> Are not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, I have omitted Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Arguments, which might be brought to prove the <hi>Brute Animals</hi> to have <hi>Souls</hi> as well as We, to have <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to Ours. And therefore, it is little leſs Injuſtice to Kill and Eat them, becauſe they cannot ſpeak and converſe with us, than it would be for a <hi>Cannibal</hi> to murder and devour thee or me, becauſe we underſtood not his <hi>Language</hi> nor he ours.</p>

But Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teaches us, <hi>That Misfortunes ſeldom ſet upon any Man ſingly; but aſſault him in Troops, whom</hi> Fate <hi>has mark'd out for Ruine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet this <hi>Prince</hi> owes his Sufferings chiefly to his own Inconſtancy, whilſt he has all along play'd faſt and looſe with the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> taking up Arms by ſucceſſive Turns for <hi>One,</hi> and at the ſame Time under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand practiſing with the <hi>Other;</hi> always Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful to Both; and only driving on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant Intereſt of his <hi>Own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is his true Character. To which we may add, an Ungovernable Diſpoſition, and an Inſatiable Thirſt of Money; which has prompted him, by all the Methods of Rapine and Violence, to heap up an Incredible Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Gold and Jewels. So that having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd the Enmity of ſeveral <hi>Monarchs,</hi> the Jealouſie of his laſt <hi>Maſter</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>

They conniv'd at his Robberies, whilſt there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thing left for him to plunder, and that they ſaw he hoarded up. But now he has done his Work, they puniſh him for the Crimes, which they themſelves encourag'd; that ſo they may become Maſters of his Wealth. 'Tis ſaid, he brook'd his Reſtraint very well at firſt: But a while agoe, being deny'd the Liberty of the <hi>Caſtle</hi>-Walls, he grew Raving Mad; flung a <hi>Candleſtick</hi> (which was all the Weapons they allow'd him) at the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>'s Head, and broke the Windows of his Lodgings. So that they have been forc'd to Confine him to a Hole without any Light, ſave a little that finds Admittance through an Iron Grate at the Top of the Room.</p>
                  <p>His Brother <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army in his Stead; who pretends great Fidelity to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> yet may in the Iſſue prove as wavering as his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Perhaps my Caſe may be the ſame as thine; and, for ought thou knoweſt, I ſeek not more to undeceive thee, than to ſatisfie my ſelf, by thus frankly venting my Thoughts: Since Nothing is more commonly obſerv'd, than that whilſt a Man is teaching another, he improves himſelf. Our Memories are frail and treacherous; and we Think ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Excellent Things, which for Want of making a deep Impreſſion, we can never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afterwards. In vain we hunt for the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Idea,</hi> and rummage all the Solitudes and Retirements of our <hi>Soul</hi> for a loſt Thought, which has left no Track or Footſteps behind it.

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102962:170"/>'tis dead as ſoon as born; nay, often proves Abortive, in the Moment it was Conceiv'd. The onely Way therefore to retain our Thoughts, is to faſten them in VVords, and chain them in Writing. This is one Cauſe that I trouble thee with Letters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that whilſt I am inſtructing thee, I may eſtabliſh my own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and confirm my ſelf in the Method I have taken, To live according to my <hi>Nature;</hi> that is, by not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering my <hi>Rational Faculties</hi> to fall aſleep, whilſt my Paſſions are Active and Vigorous in working my Ruine. For I reckon no greater Shame or Misfortune can befall a Man, than to be depriv'd of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> that is, his <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid concerning the Perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our <hi>Memories,</hi> may ſerve as proper Introduction to the Objections I ſhall make againſt your <hi>Traditionary Laws.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If one ask you, <hi>Why theſe</hi> Laws <hi>were not Written, as well as the other;</hi> You anſwer, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>took Care in this, leſt the</hi> Gentiles <hi>getting Copies of them, ſhould corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert their Sence, even as they have done the</hi> Written Laws. But how then came he to ſuffer any to be <hi>Written?</hi> Had he not equal Care of One Part, as of the Other? Or, could the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do more harm, by altering and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the leſs Subſtantial <hi>Traditions,</hi> than the very <hi>Fundamental Statutes?</hi> For, that theſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwritten Laws</hi> contain'd only Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, your <hi>Doctors</hi> themſelves confeſs. What Man of Common Sence then, can ſit down
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102962:171"/>contented with ſo trivial an Anſwer? Or, will you ſay, That <hi>God</hi> took more Care to preſerve theſe <hi>Traditions</hi> Incorrupt from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> than to retain them in their Purity among the <hi>Jews?</hi> For, that committing them to Writing, had been the ſureſt Way to retain them in their <hi>Original</hi> Purity, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by the Preſervation of the <hi>Written Law;</hi> of which there was ſo great Care taken in Tranſcribing it, that if but a Letter or a Point were added, diminiſh'd, or miſplac'd, they took it for a <hi>Fatal Omen</hi> of ſome Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and the Faulty <hi>Scribes</hi> were ſeverely puniſh'd; Nay, the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> were bound to expiate the Offence by <hi>Faſting, Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Alms.</hi> So that it was in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Impoſſible, that with all this Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the leaſt Corruption or Alteration ſhou'd creep into the <hi>Written Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I appeal now to thy own Reaſon, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this was not a much ſecurer Way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the <hi>Laws</hi> Uncorrupt, than by truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the fickle Memories of Men?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I wou'd fain know, What became of theſe <hi>Traditions</hi> during the Various <hi>Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Depopulations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Land?</hi> Who took Care to deliver theſe <hi>Traditions</hi> Unalter'd to <hi>Poſterity,</hi> when they were without <hi>Prieſts, Prophets</hi> or <hi>Synagogues?</hi> When they were diſpers'd over the Remote <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Media, Perſia, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi> In thoſe Days, your <hi>Fathers</hi> were <hi>Slaves</hi> to the <hi>Gentile Kings</hi> of <hi>Aſia;</hi> There were then no <hi>Seniors</hi> ſitting in <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> who
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102962:171"/>might take Care of theſe Things. Neither do I find, that <hi>Eſdras</hi> the <hi>Scribe</hi> was any Ways concern'd for theſe <hi>Traditions,</hi> when he with his Brethren the <hi>Jews,</hi> return'd from their <hi>Long Captivity</hi> in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> All his moſt ſtrenuous Endeavours, were employ'd in recovering the Loſt <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Written Law,</hi> without ſo much as regarding or mentioning the Other. From whence I gather, That either theſe <hi>Traditions</hi> were of no great Importance; or, if they were, yet they were wholly, or for the moſt Part chang'd or loſt, many Hundreds of Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Talmud</hi> was firſt compos'd; which, thou ſay'ſt, is the <hi>Grand Repoſitory</hi> of theſe <hi>Sacred Inſtructions.</hi> And in ſaying ſo, thou contradicteſt thy own Arguments: For, if theſe <hi>Traditions</hi> were appointed to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Mouth</hi> from <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>Son</hi> to all <hi>Generations,</hi> as you ſuppoſe; then what need was there of writing them in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or any other <hi>Book?</hi> And yet the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of your <hi>Rabbi's</hi> are full of them. Thus thou confoundeſt thy ſelf, and runneſt blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold round in a Circle of Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>Rowze up therefore thy <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not thy ſelf to be hood wink'd by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of your <hi>Rabbi's,</hi> thoſe Induſtrious <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives</hi> of Old Womens <hi>Tales.</hi> Doubtleſs theſe <hi>Traditions,</hi> about which you make ſuch a Buſtle, are no other than the <hi>Whimſies</hi> of your <hi>Cabbaliſts,</hi> who pretend to ſpie more <hi>Myſteries</hi> in the Order of Two or Three <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Letters or Points, than they are able to
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:102962:172"/>unfold in whole <hi>Volumes.</hi> They crack their Brains, in Conjuring up far-fetch'd <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> from the particular Faſhion and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of one ſingle Daſh of a Pen. They puzzle and amuſe their <hi>Diſciples,</hi> with teaching them more knotty and <hi>Romantick Divinity</hi> out of the <hi>Four</hi> and <hi>Twenty Letters,</hi> than ever <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> did with all his <hi>Myſtick Numbers.</hi> The <hi>Alphabet</hi> to them, is the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology.</hi> They have turn'd the <hi>Law</hi> into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Riddle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Believe not therefore, theſe <hi>Religious Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks,</hi> theſe <hi>Holy Jugglers,</hi> who with their ſanctify'd <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> wou'd turn you into <hi>Apes,</hi> that they may laugh in Secret at your Folly; while they behold, how preciſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout you are in cringing, jumping, dancing, howling, braying, and all your other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poſtures and Actions in the <hi>Synagogue;</hi> in the Practice of which, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd ſo much Care, and are ſo exact, that you quite neglect the <hi>Weighty Points</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope what I have ſaid, is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thee, that thoſe <hi>Traditions,</hi> which you are taught to believe were deliver'd to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> are no other, than the <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> of your <hi>Blind Guides;</hi> who are ſtudious of Nothing more, than to entangle you in a perpetual <hi>Labyrinth</hi> of <hi>Superſtition</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will not be a greater Difficulty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, That the <hi>Written Law</hi> it ſelf, though <hi>Divine</hi> in its <hi>Original,</hi> is not of <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe my Time haſtens me, I will onely ſuggeſt one Argument for all, and leave it to thy Deliberation; Whether it was poſſible for all <hi>Mankind</hi> to repair once a Year to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſacrifice in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Temple,</hi> as is requir'd in your <hi>Law?</hi> For, that it was not lawful to ſacrifice any where elſe, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both from the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbids it; and from the <hi>Examples</hi> of your <hi>Fathers</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>Captivities;</hi> and from your own <hi>Practice</hi> at this Day, who have made no <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſince the Days of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Veſpatian,</hi> the <hi>Roman Emperour,</hi> who laid waſte your City, and burnt your <hi>Temple</hi> to Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>And this alſo may ſerve to convince thee, that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not of <hi>Perpetual Obligation</hi> even to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves; ſince 'tis evident from Matters of Fact, that for theſe Sixteen Hundred Years, you have not been in a Capacity to keep it: And doubtleſs, <hi>God</hi> wou'd never require any Thing of Men, which he foreſaw, they wou'd not be able to perform.</p>
                  <p>Ceaſe then to think ſo highly of thy <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as if none but they were the <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or Capable of his Favours: Ceaſe to inſult over the Reſt of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and to curſe thy <hi>Brethren,</hi> the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>One Father,</hi> even <hi>Noah</hi>

                  <p>'Tis ſaid, That the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Orleans</hi> reſents very Ill the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Ambition, in Marrying his <hi>Nieces</hi> into the <hi>Blood-Royal.</hi> That <hi>Prince,</hi> will not be prevail'd on to come near the <hi>Court:</hi> But rather favours the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the other <hi>Malecontents.</hi> Whence ſome People are apt to preſage, another Turn of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102962:176"/>Affairs, before-long: For, the Generality of the <hi>French,</hi> are Inclin'd to the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Party.</p>
                  <p>There is great Caballing all over the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſtrives to puſh his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt forward, by all the Methods of a Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Stateſman.</hi> He knows the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Spirit too well, to dream of a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. And he has a double Intereſt, in the Ruine of that Unfortunate <hi>General;</hi> his own Preſervation, and the Aggrandizing his <hi>Niece,</hi> the <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Conti:</hi> Who by the Fall of her <hi>Brother-in-Law,</hi> will be <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of his <hi>Eſtate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He is endeavouring alſo, to make an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance</hi> with the <hi>Cardinal de Retz,</hi> his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Enemy, and one rais'd by the <hi>Pope</hi> to that <hi>Dignity,</hi> on Purpoſe to counter-balance <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s Power at this <hi>Court,</hi> where he is ſuſpected to animate the <hi>King</hi> againſt the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>Cardinal de Retz,</hi> is now a <hi>Priſoner</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and has been ſo a long Time; being firſt Confin'd by <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s Orders. But the Wiſe <hi>Miniſter,</hi> now thinks it ſafer to compound with a Man, whom he cannot longer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, without drawing on himſelf the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of all the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Thunder</hi> of the <hi>Roman Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, to reconcile Matters and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf, he has propos'd a <hi>Match</hi> between his <hi>Nephew,</hi> and <hi>de Retz</hi> his <hi>Niece.</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> is wholly taken up, with making Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of this Nature: Which is an evident
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:102962:176"/>Sign, they feel their Power at an Ebb, and fear it will be much Lower, if the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> ſhou'd once take the Field in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis nothing to the <hi>Muſſulman</hi>-Intereſt, which Side gets the Advantage. For, they are all equally Enemies to the <hi>Sent of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I can by any ſucceſsful Artifice promote the Diviſions of theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>Shining Port.</hi> However, I will ſtill pray, That thoſe Swords may be turn'd againſt each Other; which United, wou'd hazard the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>True Faithfull.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Dgnet Oglou.</head>
                  <p>THOU art not Ignorant, that when I firſt heard of the Cruel <hi>Sentence</hi> executed on our late Friend <hi>Egri Boinou</hi> (on whom be the <hi>Mercies</hi> of the <hi>Creator</hi>) I wrote to his <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, Iſmael Mouta Faraca,</hi> a Letter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doleance: Wherein, to keep a <hi>Medium</hi> between the Tenderneſs I ow'd to the Loſs which my Friend had ſuſtained of his Eyes, and the diſtruſt I had of a Stranger; I filled up my Letter to <hi>Iſmael,</hi> with Conſolatory Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſuch as I wou'd have uſed to <hi>Egri</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, had I been in his Company. Believing, that <hi>Iſmael</hi> would read my Letter, to his <hi>Blind Predeceſſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I plaid the <hi>Stoick,</hi> and encouraged the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of <hi>Apathy:</hi> Or at leaſt, I abounded in <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Counſels, almoſt as Impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as the other. Nothing but ſevere <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> dropt from my Pen. And, all this, to cover my real Concern and Paſſion for <hi>Egri</hi>'s Sufferings; who, thou Knoweſt, was beloved by more than thee and me. I told thee in a former Letter, That I did not dare to truſt my Sentiments, though diſguized, to a Man, who on the ſcore of his new <hi>Preferment</hi> might become more quick-ſighted than before, and would ſoon penetrate the thin Veil of Words, and Spy ſomething, in that <hi>Diſpatch</hi> to my
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102962:177"/>Diſadvantage, ſhould I have ventured to deſcant on the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Severity, or <hi>Egri</hi>'s Merits.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, I thought it beſt to pretend an Indifferency, to which I am as much a Stranger as any Man, in Caſes that too nearly touch our Sence. 'Tis eaſie to give Counſel to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which in the ſame Circumſtances, we are far from practiſing our ſelves. Then we can be full of Wiſdom and grave <hi>Morals;</hi> but, when it once comes Home, all our <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> vaniſhes: There remains Nothing to be ſeen, but a meer <hi>Senſitive Animal,</hi> without Vertue or Patience.</p>
                  <p>My own Experience, but two Days agoe, forces this Confeſſion from me, when by an unlucky Blow, I loſt the Sight of both my Eyes, for the Space of Eight and Fourty Hours. 'Tis true, I ſhould not have uſed them much during a Third Part of that Time, had they not been hurt: Unleſs thou wilt ſay, they are ſerviceable in our <hi>Dreams,</hi> and help our <hi>Souls</hi> to ſpy the Dark <hi>Chimaera's</hi> of the Night. However, I remember 'twas no ſmall Grief, even in that Abſence of the Sun, to be only Senſible of the Privation by my Ears: For, whilſt the Windows of my <hi>Soul</hi> were ſhut, 'twas in vain for thoſe of my Chamber to be open; which before this Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, would by letting in the Light of the <hi>Moon</hi> or <hi>Stars,</hi> have convinc'd me, that it was Night, without being beholden to the Clocks and Bells of the <hi>Convents</hi> for my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, as I was under this Affliction.</p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:102962:178"/>
                  <p>Then it was, that in my Heart I unſaid all that I had written to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> on the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Blindneſs,</hi> and curſed the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> for a Fool or a Madman, who put out his own Eyes, for the Sake of his Thoughts. I envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe more Happy Fools, who are without Thoughts, but enjoy their Sight, which helps to form and regulate the Conceits of the moſt Wiſe and Thinking Men.</p>
                  <p>Nay, ſuch was my Paſſion and Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, during this ſhort Eclipſe of my Eyes, that I preferr'd to mine, even the Life of thoſe Dumb <hi>Animals,</hi> whom Men have learned to call <hi>Irrational,</hi> becauſe they expreſs their <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents</hi> by <hi>Inarticulate Sounds,</hi> a <hi>Dialect</hi> which we don't Underſtand. And, I could have almoſt wiſhed my ſelf <hi>Metamorphos'd,</hi> though it were into a <hi>Dog,</hi> provided I might but have that Senſe, the Want of which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our Humanity Imperfect and a Burden to it ſelf. Or, if thou wilt blame me for ſuch a Wiſh, I cannot forbear thinking that <hi>Dog</hi> happier than his <hi>Maſter,</hi> whom I have ſeen leading a Blind Man in a String along the Streets of <hi>Paris.</hi> How prudently did that Faithful <hi>Creature</hi> act the <hi>Guide,</hi> in croſſing the Way, if any Danger threatned his Charge, as a Cart, Coach, or Throng of People? And, all this Conduct was oweing to his Eyes, which made him Wiſer than his <hi>Maſter;</hi> who, had he enjoy'd this <hi>Sence,</hi> might not, for ought I know, have Surpaſſed his Kind <hi>Brute</hi> in the Exerciſe of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I am fallen on this Subject, of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102962:178"/>the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>Brutes,</hi> I muſt not forget a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which I have read in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as alſo in a certain <hi>French Author,</hi> of a <hi>Dog</hi> in the <hi>Court</hi> of the <hi>Roman Emperor, Veſpaſian,</hi> which would act to the Life, all the Agonies and Symptoms of Death at the Command of a <hi>Mountebank,</hi> who had taught him many ſuch Comical Tricks, to divert the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame <hi>Frenchman</hi> mentions certain <hi>Oxen,</hi> which it ſeems had Learned <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:</hi> For, being employ'd in turning the Wheel of a Well an Hundred Times every Day, when they had finiſhed that Task, would not ſtir a ſtep more; but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved that Number in their Minds, deſiſted of their own Accord; nor could any Violence compel 'em to farther Labour. Who will deny now, that theſe <hi>Oxen</hi> were <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians;</hi> Or, That that Ship-<hi>Dog</hi> had any need to ſtudy <hi>Euclid</hi>'s <hi>Elements,</hi> who having a great Deſire to taſte of ſome Oil, that he ſaw in a deep Earthen Veſſel, and not being able to put his Head in far enough, by Reaſon of the long ſtreight Neck of the Pot, after ſome Study ran to the <hi>Hold</hi> of the Ship, which was Balaſted with Gravel-Stones. From thence he brought in his Mouth, at ſeveral Times, as many of thoſe little Stones, as half filling the Pot, forced the Oil up to the Mouth, ſo that he could Lap his Belly full. Of this, <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſays he was an Eye Witneſs. Was not this, thinkeſt thou, an <hi>Archimedes</hi> among the <hi>Dogs?</hi> Are not the <hi>Goats</hi> of <hi>Candy</hi> abſolute
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:102962:179"/>

                  <p>Should the <hi>French</hi> read theſe Lines, and thoſe others I have writ on this Subject to <hi>Cara Hali,</hi> and the Great <hi>Mahummed</hi> of the <hi>Deſart,</hi> they would cenſure me as a <hi>Heretick,</hi> a <hi>Fool,</hi> or a <hi>Madman:</hi> Or, at leaſt, they would conclude, I am too Importunate an <hi>Advocate</hi> for the <hi>Beaſts.</hi> They would call me <hi>Brute</hi> my ſelf, and fix my <hi>Pedigree</hi> among ſome of the <hi>Dumb Generations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But thou, who haſt been Educated in the ſerener <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and haſt had the Honour to pour <hi>Water</hi> on the <hi>Hands</hi> of the Abſtemious <hi>Eremit,</hi> wilt have another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of what I ſay, in Defence of our <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Animals.</hi>

                  <p>In <hi>Bretagne,</hi> and <hi>Province</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> above Forty Old Women have been ſeiz'd and Impriſon'd, for holding Correſpondence with <hi>Infernal Powers:</hi> And above half of them, condemn'd to Death; <hi>God</hi> knows with what Juſtice.</p>

                  <p>Yet it cannot be deny'd, but that there have been both Men and Women vers'd in <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Arts, as they are commonly call'd, which I take to be only the more <hi>Myſterious Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi> Such was <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> the Great Grand-Child of <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of that Part of <hi>Aſia</hi> which was then call'd <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctria.</hi> Such was <hi>Apollonius Tyaneus, Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides Syracuſanus,</hi> with many others of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Date: Theſe underſtood the Hidden Force of the <hi>Elements,</hi> the <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Stars,</hi> the Specifick Operation of Metals, Minerals, and other Subterranean Bodies, with the Virtues of all Vegetables. They knew exactly how to frame <hi>Aſtral Images</hi> and <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> by the Help of which they were able to effect Wonders. And all this perhaps, without once dreaming of <hi>Infernal Spirits,</hi> or having the leaſt Society with <hi>Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I believe, <hi>Lucian,</hi> an Ancient <hi>Writer,</hi> who never ſpoke ſeriouſly of any Thing, ſcarce believ'd himſelf, when he related the <hi>Story</hi> of <hi>Pancrates,</hi> a Famous <hi>Magician</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who by theſe <hi>Taliſmans,</hi> was able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Inanimate</hi> things into the Appearance at leaſt of <hi>Living</hi> Creatures. Thus he wou'd turn a Stick or Piece of Wood into a ſeeming Man, who ſhou'd walk, diſcourſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the Actions of a <hi>Rational Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A certain Stranger travelling with him once to <hi>Memphis,</hi> and lying with him in the ſame <hi>Carvanſera,</hi> as ſoon as they were alighted
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102962:182"/>from their Camels, <hi>Pancrates</hi> took a <hi>Plank</hi> of <hi>Oak,</hi> and having touch'd it with his <hi>Taliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and pronounc'd Two or Three Syllables, incontinently the <hi>Stock</hi> mov'd, ſtood upright, walk'd, and taking the Camels by the Bridle, led them to the Stables: After which, this <hi>Wooden Man</hi> came in and prepar'd their <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law;</hi> went of whatſoever Errands <hi>Pancrates</hi> ſent him. And when they departed, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician</hi> uſing a certain Private <hi>Ceremony,</hi> this Officious Servant return'd to a <hi>Plank</hi> again. This was his Practice all along the Road.</p>
                  <p>One Day his Fellow-Traveller being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to try the Experiment, took Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the <hi>Magician</hi>'s Abſence, who was gone to the <hi>Temple,</hi> and had left his <hi>Taliſman</hi> behind him. The Curious Travelle, having been often an Eye Witneſs of this Trick, takes a Piece of <hi>Wood,</hi> and touches it with <hi>Pancra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s <hi>Taliſman,</hi> repeating the Syllables he had heard him utter. Immediately the <hi>Inanimate Timber</hi> became a <hi>Man,</hi> asking his Pleaſure. The Traveller aſtoniſh'd at the Event, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his new Servant to bring him a Bucket of Water. The Enchanted Spark obeys. The Traveller told him it was enough, and bid him return to a Piece of <hi>Wood</hi> again; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, he continu'd drawing of Water, and bringing it in till the Houſe was full. The Traveller fearing the Anger of <hi>Pancrates,</hi> thought to diſſolve the <hi>Enchamment,</hi> by cleaving the <hi>Wooden</hi> Animal in Two. But this augmented his Trouble: For, each Piece taking a Bucket, fell to drawing of Water;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:102962:182"/>ſo that of One Servant he had made Two. This continued till the <hi>Magician</hi> came to his Reſcue, who having ſternly rebuk'd the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller's Raſhneſs, at a Word turn'd the Two buſie Drudges, to their Primitive Loggiſhneſs and Inactivity again.</p>
                  <p>I do not tell this Story, as if I would have thee believe it, or that I give Credit to it my ſelf. Let us imitate the <hi>Author</hi> of it, who laughs at all that delight in ſuch <hi>Fables.</hi> But the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who believe a <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> is Transform'd to <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an <hi>Immortal God,</hi> at the pronouncing of Four Words by the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> may be excus'd, if they put Confidence in the <hi>Figments</hi> of <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Orators.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have in my Cuſtody the <hi>Journal</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coa,</hi> who formerly reſided at <hi>Vienna,</hi> a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Agent</hi> for the <hi>Ever Happy Port.</hi> Some of his Letters ſpeak of the Superſtition and Credulity of the <hi>Germans,</hi> in this Kind. Yet in a Letter to the <hi>Mufti,</hi> he acknowledges himſelf overcome by the Unqueſtionable Teſtimonies, of ſuch as had been Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> of one <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> a <hi>German Magician,</hi> who play'd a Thouſand <hi>Infernal</hi> Pranks (as he calls them) even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Emperour</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He tells alſo of another <hi>Magician</hi> call'd <hi>Zyto,</hi> who liv'd in the Days of the <hi>Emperour Charles</hi> IV. And when the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Son to whom <hi>Zyto</hi> belong'd, was to Marry the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Daughter; the <hi>Duke</hi> to oblige his Son-in-Law, who was much
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:102962:183"/>taken with <hi>Magical</hi> Tricks, as were all the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſent for a great many Famous <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers</hi> to the Wedding. Among the Reſt, while One was performing a rare Exploit, on a ſudden <hi>Zyto</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Conjurer,</hi> came up to him with a Mouth ſeeming as Wide as that of an Old <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and ſwallows him up at a Morſel. When he thus had done, he retires and voids him again in a Baſh, and brings him thus drench'd, into the Company, challenging any of the other <hi>Magicians,</hi> to do a Feat like that; but they were all ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>
                  <p>I hear of no ſuch Tricks done by thoſe <hi>French Witches,</hi> who cauſe ſo much Diſcourſe at preſent. The worſt they are accus'd of, is, Bewitching their neighbours Hogs to Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which thou knoweſt may be only a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Malady.</p>
                  <p>I pray <hi>Heaven</hi> defend us from the <hi>Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of a deluded <hi>Phanſy,</hi> that Domeſtick <hi>Incubus</hi> of every Mortal, and we need fear neither <hi>Witch</hi> nor <hi>Wizard.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Place is called <hi>Gravelines,</hi> whereof I have made Mention in ſome of my former Letters. On the 29th of the laſt <hi>Moon,</hi> the Powder of the <hi>Magazine</hi> there took Fire, whether by Accident or Deſign, is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. But the Damage it has done, is very great. It is reported, That a Third Part of the City is blown up, and the Chief <hi>Fortifications</hi> about it, with the <hi>Outworks</hi> of the <hi>Cittadel.</hi> Three Thouſand Mortals, had their Breath exhauſted by the Violent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion of the Air, and were ſent into <hi>Another World,</hi> well ſeaſon'd with <hi>Salt-Peter:</hi> Beſides a vaſt Multitude of all Sorts, that were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd in the Ruines of the Houſes.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay, a certain Perſon coming to buy ſome Powder of the <hi>Steward</hi> of the <hi>Magazine;</hi> as they were knocking out the Head of a Powder-Barrel, the Hammer ſtruck Fire. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers report, That this Perſon who pretended to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:102962:186"/>buy Powder, was a <hi>Spy</hi> or <hi>Private Agent</hi> of <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi> in thoſe <hi>Parts:</hi> And that by his <hi>Maſter</hi>'s Order, he had prepar'd a certain <hi>Artificial</hi> Fire, enclos'd in a <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Box;</hi> and that at a certain determin'd Period of Time, it would cauſe the <hi>Box</hi> to flie in Pieces, and ſcatter Flames almoſt as ſubtle and penetrating as thoſe of <hi>Lightning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having therefore this little Inſtrument of Miſchief ready, and being inſtructed in all Things, he with the <hi>Steward</hi> enter'd the Vaults where the Powder lay, under Pretence of buying ſome for the <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi> And when they had open'd one of the Barrels, he thruſt his Hand among the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as though he wou'd take up ſome to look upon; at the ſame Time dextrouſly convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his little <hi>Shell</hi> or <hi>Box</hi> into the Barrel, knowing, that in an Hours Time it wou'd work its Effect. In the mean while, ſeeming to diſlike that Barrel, they open'd another; which he bought, and ſo departed. Within an Hour afterwards, all the Countries round about, were aſtoniſh'd at the Dreadful Blow which made the Earth to tremble: They ſay, it was heard beyond the Seas into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Contrivance of this <hi>Tragedy,</hi> is faſten'd on <hi>Mazarini;</hi> and ſuch is the Hatred the People bear to this <hi>Miniſter,</hi> That if an <hi>Earthquake</hi> ſhou'd happen in theſe <hi>Parts,</hi> I believe they wou'd accuſe him as the <hi>Author</hi> of it.</p>

                  <p>But it ſeems, as if all the <hi>Elements</hi> were at <hi>War</hi> againſt the <hi>Netherland Provinces.</hi> I have already acquainted the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Ever Happy Por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>To</hi> Mehemet, <hi>an</hi> Eunuch <hi>in the</hi> Seraglio.</head>
                  <p>I Acquainted thee formerly with the firſt Neceſſity I had to drink Wine, that I might the better conceal my being a <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> when I was made a Priſoner by <hi>Cardinal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarini</hi>'s Order. I tell thee now, this Liquor is grown Habitual to me; it being the <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Beverage</hi> of the <hi>Country</hi> where I am. But the <hi>French</hi> temper it with Water, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to allay their Thirſt, and prevent <hi>Fevers:</hi> Which Cuſtom agrees not with the Stomach of a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> who when he drinks either Water or Wine, loves to have them Pure without Mixture. I uſe it moderately for my Health, and to create an Appetite. But this Evening, I drank a Glaſs of Wine, which is like to make me abhorr it for Ever. In all Probability, I ſhall turn as ſtrict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe as an <hi>Hodgia.</hi> For, in the Midſt of my Draught, I had almoſt ſwallowed a Great <hi>Spider,</hi> which lay drowned in the Wine. The little <hi>Beaſt,</hi> had paſs'd my Lips; but I ſoon clear'd my Mouth, of ſo Ungrateful a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. I wiſh I could as eaſily diſcharge my <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination,</hi> of the hated <hi>Idea's</hi> it has imbibed with this <hi>Fatal Potion.</hi> Not that I think I am poiſoned, or have received any Real Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102962:187"/>from the <hi>Spider:</hi> The worſt <hi>Venom,</hi> lies in my own <hi>Phancy.</hi> It will be Impoſſible for all the Water in <hi>France,</hi> to waſh away the Prejudices I have Conceiv'd againſt this little <hi>Inſect.</hi> I have a perfect <hi>Antipathy</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. The Sight of a <hi>Spider,</hi> would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make me ſweat and tremble. Now, if ever I ſhould taſte of Wine again, I ſhould imagine every Mouthful I ſwallowed, had a <hi>Spider</hi> in it. My <hi>Reaſon</hi> tells me, there were no Danger, if I had one in my Stomach; having ſeen a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> without the Uſe of any <hi>Antidote,</hi> ſwallow Two or Three large <hi>Spiders</hi> in a Glaſs of Wine: And this was his ordinary Practice every Morning. And moſt of that <hi>Profeſſion</hi> maintain, That <hi>Spiders</hi> ſo drank, can do no harm. Yet my <hi>Antipathy</hi> overcomes my <hi>Reaſon</hi> in this Point. And if <hi>Galen</hi> or <hi>Hippocrates</hi> were alive, they would not be able with all their Learned <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations,</hi> to reconcile me to a <hi>Creature,</hi> for which I have an <hi>Invincible Averſion</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence.</hi> I had rather encounter with a <hi>Lyon</hi> or a <hi>Tyger,</hi> in the <hi>Deſerts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded I had but a Sword in my Hand, than to have a <hi>Spider</hi> crawling about me in the Dark. And therefore, I have often envied the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>-Men; for, in that <hi>Iſland,</hi> they ſay no <hi>Venomous Creature</hi> will live. The ſame is reported, of the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Malta.</hi> Which Wonderful Privilege, both theſe <hi>Iſlands</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, to the <hi>Prayers</hi> of certain <hi>Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Reaſon to be given for theſe ſecret <hi>Antipathies,</hi> which are diſcovered in
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:102962:188"/>many Men. Some will ſweat and faint away, if there be a <hi>Cat</hi> in the Room where they are, though they know Nothing of it, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by the <hi>Secret Intimations</hi> of this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>naccountable Sence,</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their other <hi>Five.</hi> I have ſeen a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman drop down in a Swoon, as ſoon as he entered a Chamber, where there was a <hi>Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> kept in a Cage. And thoſe that knew him, ſaid, It was his conſtant Infirmity.</p>
                  <p>If there be any Truth in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Soul's Tranſmigration,</hi> I ſhould think the beſt Reaſons for theſe private <hi>Antipathies,</hi> might be drawn from ſome <hi>Former State</hi> of the <hi>Soul.</hi> And according to that <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That I had been a <hi>Flie,</hi> before I came into this <hi>Body;</hi> and having been frequently perſecuted by <hi>Spiders</hi> in that <hi>State,</hi> do ſtill retain the Dread of my <hi>Old Enemy,</hi> which all the Circumſtances of my preſent <hi>Metamorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> are not able to efface. But if this be ſo, I wonder I ſhou'd have no diſtinct Remembrance of my former little <hi>Volatile</hi> Life; ſince <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> the Great <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>Metempſychoſis</hi> declares, That he could remember ſeveral <hi>Changes</hi> he had undergone. And particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recounts, how he led a Merrier Life when he was a <hi>Frog,</hi> than ſince he became a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It affords me Matter of Thought and is no ſmall Diverſion, to behold the Contrariety that is in Mens Dier. One Man never taſtes of <hi>Fiſh</hi> all his days, another abhorrs <hi>Fleſh;</hi> this faints if his <hi>Bread</hi> be cut with a Knife
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:102962:188"/>that has touched <hi>Cheeſe,</hi> that ſwoons at the Smell of <hi>Mutton.</hi> Men have as different Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, as they have Faces. Some are ſquea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and almoſt nauſeate every Thing that others eat freely of. Again, there are others to whom nothing comes amiſs. For my Part, I have many Averſions in Point of Diet: And, above all Things, I can never be reconciled to the eating of <hi>Inſects, Serpents</hi> and other <hi>Reptile Creatures.</hi> Yet here are Men in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> who live upon <hi>Frogs, Vipers, Graſhoppers,</hi> and ſuch Kind of Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Animals.</hi> And I have read of a <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in the <hi>Southern Parts</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> who had no other Diet but ſalted <hi>Locuſts,</hi> which they catch in the <hi>Spring:</hi> When certain <hi>Winds,</hi> bring Innumerable ſwarms of them over the Land, ſo that all the <hi>Country</hi> is covered. Theſe <hi>People</hi> are very Lean, Active and Black. They run ſwift as <hi>Stags,</hi> and will climb Trees and jump from one Bough and Tree to another as nimbly as <hi>Apes</hi> or <hi>Squirrels.</hi> But they are ſhort Liv'd, never exceeding Forty Years of Age. For, about that Time, they feel a Violent Itching all over their Bodies: Which tempting them to ſcratch themſelves, they never ceaſe till they make Holes in their Fleſh, where certain Winged <hi>Inſects</hi> breed; which multiply ſo faſt, that in a little Time they devour the poor Wretches. This is thought to be the Reſult of their Ill Diet.</p>
                  <p>Let not what I have ſaid, create any Squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhneſs in thee, but eat thy <hi>Pillaw</hi> with a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:102962:189"/>good Stomach: For, that <hi>Food,</hi> has the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophet.</hi>

                  <p>The ſame <hi>Poſt</hi> alſo tells us, of a Mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> which are enter'd into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> deſtroying and laying deſolate where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they come. The pretended Cauſe of this Invaſion, is ſaid to be, a Diſguſt the <hi>Czar</hi> has taken at a certain <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> and <hi>Poet</hi> of <hi>Poland;</hi> Who in reciting the <hi>Wars</hi> between thoſe <hi>Nations,</hi> had made a Miſtake in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy</hi> of the <hi>Moſcovite Emperours,</hi> naming the <hi>Father</hi> for the <hi>Son.</hi> The <hi>Czar</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of this, demanded the Head of the <hi>Writer,</hi> as an Atonement: Which being

                  <p>HItherto I have been in a <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> or at leaſt I'll ſuppoſe it, wandring up and down, loſt and confounded in the Dark, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sun, Star, Land-Mark, or any Faithful <hi>Guide</hi> to direct me. What ſhall I do in this Caſe? I am tyr'd with Perpetual Rambling;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102962:190"/>and reſt I dare not, neither can I, ſuch is my Uneaſineſs, even in the only Circumſtance which gives to other Men Repoſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus I diſcourſe with my ſelf when I am alone, and conſider my Prefent State as a <hi>Mortal.</hi> The <hi>Miſeries</hi> of this <hi>Life,</hi> are the <hi>Themes</hi> of my Firſt Contemplation: And 'tis but Reaſon it ſhould be ſo, becauſe we feel 'em every Moment. They touch our Sence nearly, and afflict us with ſharp Pains. Yet they are but like the <hi>Sting</hi> of a <hi>Waſp,</hi> Violent for a Time, but laſt not long.</p>
                  <p>This Thought carries me farther, and puts me upon an Endleſs Meditation, what will befall me after I'm Dead. When I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated all that I can, run over a Thouſand Paths of Phaney, and track'd all the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of the <hi>Wiſe,</hi> or of ſuch as were eſteem'd ſo, ſtill I find my ſelf in a <hi>Deſert,</hi> more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangl'd than a Traveller loſt in the <hi>Foreſt,</hi> of <hi>Hercynia,</hi> which extends from the moſt <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly</hi> Part of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> to ſome <hi>Provinces</hi> in the <hi>German Empire,</hi> and is reputed Five Hundred Leagues in Length.</p>
                  <p>In this bewilder'd Condition, I meet with many pretending Guides, One telling me <hi>this</hi> is the Way, Another <hi>that.</hi> But becauſe they do not agree in their Advice, I know not which to truſt: And am inclin'd to ſuſpect ſome for Cheats, and the Reſt for Fools, as much at a Loſs, if not more than my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Permit me to diſcourſe with Freedom, my Dear <hi>Gnet,</hi> and let us unmask like Friends. What ſignifies all that the <hi>Imaum's</hi> and <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lahs</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:102962:191"/>can ſay of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> ſince none of 'em have been there to make an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Why ſhould we ſuffer our ſelves to be amus'd with Notions of Things, which, for ought we know, have no other Exiſtence, but in the <hi>Harangues</hi> of the <hi>Preachers,</hi> and the <hi>Phanſies</hi> of the <hi>Credulous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Think not that I am going to perſwade thee to the <hi>Hereſy</hi> of the <hi>Muſerin,</hi> who deny the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God.</hi> I tell thee, I am no <hi>Atheiſt.</hi> From Every Thing I behold, my Thought ſoon flies up to a Firſt <hi>Cauſe:</hi> And there 'tis daſh'd into a Thouſand <hi>Queries.</hi> This I lay as a Solid Foundation, <hi>All Things were not Always in the ſame State as they are Now.</hi> (My Experience demonſtrates to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.) But how much longer they have been otherwiſe, than my own Remembrance, I cannot be aſſur'd, but by the Confidence which I repoſe in People that are Older than my ſelf, and the Faith I give to <hi>Books.</hi> Both which agree in this, That they are Guilty of Contradictions without Number.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that were born before me, and Liv'd in the Days of <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> III tell me many Paſſages of his <hi>Reign,</hi> quite different from the Relations of others, who alſo Liv'd in thoſe <hi>Times,</hi> and remark'd the Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their <hi>Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A like Diſagreement I find among <hi>Authors,</hi> who have committed to Writing, the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of <hi>Former Times.</hi> 'Tis difficult to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with Two Men of the ſame <hi>Opinion,</hi> even as to Matters of Fact. Some take a Pride
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102962:191"/>in diſguizing the Truth; Whilſt others have not Skill to take off the Mask. There are a Sort of Perſons in the World, Men of Supine and Eaſie Judgments, Credulous, and not daring to call in Queſtion what has been tranſmitted to them from the <hi>Authority</hi> of Such and Such a <hi>Writer.</hi> They Superſtitiouſly revere as an <hi>Oracle,</hi> the <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> of a Mortal Man like themſelves, and Subject to as many Frailties and Miſtakes. And all this, only becauſe they have been taught to do ſo from their <hi>Infancy:</hi> So Forcible is the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Education.</hi> Thus the <hi>Hebrews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Records</hi> of their <hi>Nation</hi> to be of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Original, though they want not <hi>Verbal</hi> Contradictions, and abound with <hi>Logical</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Inconſiſtencies.
